This meteoric rise ultimately culminated in two unsuccessful spells in the English Premiership. Rotherham is perhaps best known for the Rugby Football Union blocking its entry into the Premiership, its subsequent legal challenges, and a partially successful appeal to the Office of fair trading to break an alleged Premiership cartel.\n\nRotherham is now consistently a top 20 club in English rugby, with a reputation for being a breeding ground for developing talented players, including those who are overlooked by other top clubs such as David Strettle, Hendre Fourie and Erik Lund.\n\n==History==\n\n===1923–1986===\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s the club regularly turned out two teams and on odd occasions three, normally in school holiday periods when local 6th-formers played.\n\nRotherham in common with many clubs shut down during the Second World War and the club was reformed in 1946 at Clifton Lane. The next fifteen years were a struggle in terms of running teams and raising finance to improve facilities. The club received a big boost when a local secondary modern school started rugby and soon a regular supply of players were coming through. Rugby started to be played in many local schools and the arrival of a number of Physical Education teachers in the area who were rugby specialists helped both the playing standard and the club organisation.\n\nPrior to the advent of a national league structure, Rotherham struggled to get fixtures against establishment sides, largely from the south of England, meaning when the league was established they were placed well down the league structure despite always showing an ambition to develop. This perceived snub by other top teams, and placement at the bottom of the rugby hierarchy fired the initial drive up the leagues and led to several former players such as Mike Yarlett investing their time and resources to transform the club.\n\n===1987–1995===\nRotherham entered league rugby in 1987 enjoying enormous success with seven subsequent promotions culminating by eventually reaching the Premiership. In the 1988–89 season, Rotherham won the North East 1 title and so began its rise up the rugby pyramid. This was immediately followed up by five further promotions in six seasons to propel the club to the fourth tier of English rugby by 1995–96.\n\nThis period in the club's development was later to be considered the start of the \"golden decade\", and secured legendary status for several players including John Dudley, Richard Selkirk, Craig West and Kevin Plant. During this period Rotherham attracted some criticism for their early adoption of paying players during a period later referred to as \"Shamateurism\" as most progressive clubs in essence paid their players while keeping up the pretence of being Amateur clubs.\n\nIn this era, the Yorkshire Cup, still a prestigious competition in which all the top Yorkshire sides competed, became a symbolic quest for the Rotherham players and management. The competition had been dominated for the previous 25 years by Wakefield, Harrogate and the four big Leeds clubs, Headingley, Roundhay, Morley and Otley, none of whom would give Rotherham a fixture prior to the introduction of league rugby. Rotherham reached the final for the first time in their history in 1993, going down 22–5 to Otley, however 2 years later there was no doubting that Rotherham had arrived as they defeated Harrogate 39-3 at Kirkstall to win the Cup for the first and to date only time.\n\nThe 1994 County Championship final at Twickenham also provided further evidence of Rotherham's ascent to senior club status in Yorkshire, as Kevin Plant and Craig West were members of the Yorkshire side (along with soon to be Rotherham scrum-half Guy Easterby — then with Harrogate) who won the championship in exhilarating fashion with a 26–3 triumph over Durham.\n\nSummarising the success in 1995, the independent put Rotherham's success into context saying:{{cquote|The Morley outside-half Kevin Plant was the next significant arrival at Clifton Lane, with the RAF and Lancashire scrum-half Steve Worrall soon joining him. However, Forster's masterstroke was to persuade the Yorkshire No 8 Richard Selkirk to leave Headingley and take over the captaincy. With Selkirk and Forster at the helm, Rotherham swept through the Northern League, winning promotion three times - twice after unbeaten campaigns and each time as champions - to lift the Whitbread Junior Club of the Year trophy in 1992.}}\n\n===1996–1999===\nRotherham eventually reached the Courage National Division 1 in 1996–97, finishing seventh in their first season. 1997 also witnessed one of Rotherhams stellar days at Clifton Lane in the 6th round of the Pilkington Cup. Rotherham Lost 23–42. Rotherham Advertiser 31 January 1997 said of the game: {{cquote|But one thing was certain, it was another landmark in Rotherham's climb towards the top of the game. Playing Quins in the league may seem a impossibility in the current financially governed rugby climate - but then again it's not too long ago that the thought of Will Carling trotting out at Clifton Lane was merely a dream.}} The 1997–98 season saw Rotherham improve on their first Division One season to fourth, while the next year 1998–99 saw Rotherham finish equal on points with first place Bristol, the West Country side prevailing on points difference, setting Roth up for a promotion playoff. Ultimately they were denied cruelly by the aggregate tries rule, having tied the scores with the Premiership's second bottom side Bedford at 38–38, leaving Rotherham to endure another season in National Division One. However, in 1999–2000 Rotherham enjoyed a near faultless season, losing only two games and winning their first National League One title, setting up a promotion playoff re-match with Bedford. The first leg saw Rotherham score four tries winning 40–20 at home, while the second leg was one of Rotherham's most dramatic; conceding two penalty tries losing 14–0 to win on aggregate 40–34 gaining promotion to the top tier.\n\n===2000–2003===\nFor 2000–01 Rotherham won promotion to become Yorkshire's first ever representative in the top tier of English rugby. The Independent said of Rotherham entry to the premiership:\n\n{{cquote|There will be a culture shock awaiting rugby union's elite clubs when they arrive in Rotherham this season, especially in the clubhouse which resonates with rugby virtues from a bygone era.... Rotherham do not recognise celebrity; they are without artifice or pretension.}} The club endured a torrid yet promising year as they struggled to win games, several were lost by mere points. However, highlights of the season included victories at Clifton Lane against London Irish (19–18) and Saracens (19–8), which saw some of the biggest attendances in the club's history as up to 4,000 supporters crammed into Clifton Lane. Disappointingly Rotherham finished bottom and were relegated to National Division 1 after one season.\n\n2001–02 saw Rotherham return to National One having gained experience and develop as a club. Rotherham duly romped to their second National Division One title in three years, losing only two games all season. The success of the league title was quickly dampened by the decision that Rotherham were to be denied promotion to the Premiership as they did not fulfil the ever changing entry requirements.\n\nRotherham remained in National Division One for the 2002–03 determined to overcome the previous season's setback, and demonstrated their consistency by once again recording a near perfect season as they once again lost only two games all season, climaxing as Rotherham became champions by beating Worcester away in one of the club's most memorable moments. The Guardian on 13 April 2003 said of the battles with Worcester;{{cquote|For years, it seems, they've been the Celtic and Rangers of their division, few other matches seeming to matter but the pair's annual pitched battles. But the big difference is that the Scottish football giants don't go up, or down. Rotherham have now all but ensured their escape from English rugby's first division with this professional-looking win, built on organisation, strong defence and no important errors}}This was the club's third National Division One title in four years, and this time welcomed automatic promotion back to the premiership.\n\nIn June 2003 after a 5-month enquiry by Anthony Arlidge QC, Rotherham were acquitted of any wrongdoing in the \"Rotherham-Gate\" saga, an enquiry which the Premiership were generally consider to have treated with disdain, and ultimately cast serious questions over the conduct of several Premiership Chairmen. The Telegraph reported:\n\n{{cquote|Rotherham have been the focus of Arlidge's considerable scrutiny. They were the only entity involved in this whole, drawn-out matter, to give him full cooperation.... \"Mr Barwell was not prepared to put his mouth where his convictions lay,\" Arlidge writes...... Arlidge notes that \"cooperation from Premier Rugby has been most disappointing and that has made my task more difficult\".}}The 2003–04 season saw a return to the Premiership for Rotherham and a change of name asa sponsorship deal with Titan Environmental lead to the adoption of the 'Titans' nickname. The Titans had been sharing Millmoor stadium with Rotherham United Football Club since the start of the 2002–03 season, but Millmoor proved even less of a happy top-flight hunting ground than Clifton Lane as Rotherham struggled to adapt on their return, the Titans being relegated from the top-flight of professional rugby union in 2003–04 after only one season, disappointingly without winning a single match. At the end of that season, Mike Yarlett, the owner who had bankrolled the club's rise through the leagues, withdrew his backing, and extinction appeared to be a distinct possibility. It became clear Yarlett's withdrawal of his backing had come after significant frustration with the RFU at their failure to meet his request to guarantee the possibility of promotion from National Division 1 to the Premiership.\n\nThe club was rescued by a local consortium headed by local businessmen Nick Cragg and Martin Jenkinson who had both previously played for the club. Donations from supporters, assurances from Rotherham Council, who valued the club's community work, and the acceptance of savage wage cuts from players ensured that Rotherham could continue in business albeit after a return to their spiritual home ground at Clifton Lane. In the Daily Mail in September 2004, Martin Jenkison said:\n\n{{cquote|\"There is a club here that goes back to the 1920s and there are a heck of a lot of people that this club means a heck of a lot to..... Irrespective of whether a limited company goes into liquidation, there is a spirit here that we all thought was worth saving. Everything has been condensed into four weeks, there has been masses of good will from so many people and nobody wanted to see rugby in this town die\"}}In 2004 there was widespread outcry at the RFU's support of a proposed takeover of Rotherham by a South Africa consortia who wanted to move the club to London.\n\n===2004–2006===\n\nThe 2004–05 season started with five wins in a row for the Titans, but the reality of their financial situation, and vast scale of squad changes this had caused, soon kicked in. The Titans finished in their worst ever position in the National Division One in eighth.\n\n2005–06 saw Andre Bester take control of the club in the double role of chief executive and head coach. With attendances between 920 and 2250, the Titans managed to improve to finish fourth in National Division One below an unstoppable Harlequins, who bounced back to the premiership. The club were known as 'Earth Titans' throughout the term of a sponsorship deal with Hellaby-based finance house Earth Money.\n\nThe next season 2006–07, the Titans lost the likes of David Strettle, a future England star and Chris Hala'ufia to Harlequins, but brought in players which Bester felt had the potential to help the Titans win National Division One, such as Ireland U21 International Gareth Steenson and Scotland 7s Andrew Turnbull. This saw a resurgence from Rotherham as they made a good start to the National Division One campaign. The most notable victory was beating Leeds 22–19 in a very close match which the Titans stole at the death with a penalty from Gareth Steenson. Rotherham finished in second place, five points behind Leeds Tykes.\n\n===2007–2010===\nThe Titans signed a record sponsorship deal with Complete Technical Services in June 2007, however 2007–08 was a disappointing season following on from the previous years success as Titans slumped to eleventh. Northampton recorded a perfect season going unbeaten and returning to the Premiership. Rotherham finished the 2008–09 season in tenth as they sought to rebuild the team. 2009–10 saw Rotherham's worst league finish in thirteen years since they were first promoted to National Division One. Despite this poor finish, and finding themselves in the relegation playoffs, they never looked in danger of demotion as they won all but one of their games to top the group.\n\nRotherham looked to mount a fresh challenge for the 2010–11 season and succeeded in improving on the previous few seasons, finishing seventh and in the promotion playoffs. Ryan Burrows, Juan Pablo Socino & Adam Kettle enjoyed particularly impressive seasons respectively. Andre Bester aimed to secure a squad for the following year prior to the playoffs and the club effectively released several players prior to the end of the season, the ensuing lack of motivation being a contributory factor to the Titans losing every playoff game to finish the season.\n\n===2011–2012===\nThe 2011–12 RFU Championship brought excitement back to the club as many new faces were brought in while retaining the core of the previous years squad. Titans assembled one of the largest packs in the league backed up with an impressive back line and quickly became a team to fear. New players such as Semisi Tualava, Palepoi Nonu, Adrian \"The Enforcer\" Griffiths, Garry Law, Robin Copeland & Jimmy Williams had an immediate positive impact, whilst the likes of Rob O'Donnell, Jamie Kilbane & Cliffie Hodgson extended their stay to further bolster the squad. The club enjoyed a run of seven unbeaten home games in the Championship including impressive victories against Bristol (44–6), Bedford (40–32) and also winning on the road at London Welsh (33–25). Rotherham currently have a winning record and are aiming for a top four finish leading to the promotion playoffs.\n\nAs of January 2012 Rotherham were the number one ranked team in Yorkshire, overtaking Leeds Carnegie and the third highest team in the North of England behind only Sale Sharks and the Newcastle Falcons\n\nOn 24 January Rotherham signed two scrum halves on trial, Dale Farnham joined from Plymouth Albion; and Danny Matthews who had previously played at Leeds Met University alongside team mates Barney Maddison and Ben Hooper while playing at the University. Subsequently, on 25 January, Rotherham also signed Tom Armes as a dual registered player from Leicester Tigers.{{wide image|Rotherham Secure Bonus Point Against Bristol.jpg|360px|Rotherham Titans securing a 4 try bonus point against Bristol Rugby}}\n\n===Historic rivalries===\nDue to Rotherham's rapid rise up the league structure it wasn't until the late 1990s that they developed any regular rivals. The first of these were Wakefield who were the most senior team from Yorkshire in the upper levels of rugby union. At the time Wakefield had a number of the most experienced players outside the top flight including Dave Scully, Terry Garnett and Rod Latham all of whom eventually moved to play for Rotherham as Roth superseded Wakefield as the senior side in Yorkshire.\n\nUnusually the next two rivals weren't local, both Bedford Blues and Worcester Warriors were promotion rivals to Rotherham and had a number of epic games between 1999 and 2002. During this period Rotherham were regular victors over both of these teams including against Bedford in a play off to gain promotion to the Premiership, and in a key game against Worcester Warriors which all but sealed promotion to the Premiership for the second time.\n\nThe third period of rivalry pitted Rotherham against local rivals Leeds Carnegie and then Doncaster Knights.\n\n==Home ground==\nRotherham play their home games at Clifton Lane sports ground (capacity 2,500) which they share with Rotherham Town Cricket Club. As a result, the club has been unable to develop the ground, as the Titans pitch serves as the outfield for the cricket club. In 2001–02 during Rotherham's first season in the premiership the club expanded the capacity to approximately 4,000 by using temporary stands which were situated on the south east side of the ground. The ground consists of a main covered stand referred to as \"the shed\", and a number of concrete standing areas and small terraces. \"The Shed\" is generally considered to produce a highly partisan and passionate atmosphere on match days and is often quoted as being part of the team's strong home record.\n\nRotherham Titans moved to Clifton Lane in the late 1930s and have played every league season at Clifton Lane apart from the 2003–04 Premiership season during Rotherham's second stint as they instead shared Millmoor stadium with Rotherham United Football Club to satisfy promotion criteria. Rotherham returned to Clifton Lane the following year.\n\nThe Titans still need to resolve issues surrounding facilities. They have been turned down for promotion before due to this, and require better facilities if they are to be promoted. As aforementioned The Titans have shared Millmoor stadium with Rotherham United Football Club in the past. Rotherham United Football Club’s Chairman, Dennis Coleman, had mentioned the possibility of sharing the newly constructed New York Stadium. However the Titans opted out of the use of this stadium as they pursued alternative facilities.\n\nIn 2010–11 season, the ground was sponsored by Stafforce recruitment and is sometimes quoted as being called the \"Stafforce Stadium\".\n\nIn 2011 Rotherham Titans spent several months seeking an agreement with the owners of Millmoor CF Booth Ltd to use the unused stadium as their home ground. After much speculation it was announced in December 2011 that the Titans would remain at Clifton Lane for the foreseeable future due to the deal falling through.\n\n===Community Foundation===\nClifton Lane is the base for several high-profile community programmes through the club's flagship Community Foundation. The Community Foundation has received considerable praise for working with vulnerable and disadvantaged young people, using the players as role models helping to improve the participants' life skills.\n\nInstrumental in the foundation's set up was Brian Chapple, who later went on to be the Community Foundation{{clarify|date=April 2015}} at Rotherham United. While the foundation was set up to support the community, the value added by the foundation was one of the main reasons that Rotherham Council helped save the Titans after financial meltdown in 2003. The Daily Mail in 2004 reported:{{cquote|Roger Stone, the leader of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, indicated the club's community work was pivotal in his decision to release the funds.\"We are trying to hang on to the community issues and the way that everyone has come together to keep this club operating.

They formed in 1976 and disbanded in 1992 having released four albums. The band reunited in 2008, and released new albums in 2011 and 2017. \n\nAlthough not commercially successful, the Feelies had an influence on the development of American indie rock. Their first album, Crazy Rhythms (Stiff Records, 1980) was cited by R.E.M. as a major influence. The Feelies were influenced by the Velvet Underground and Lou Reed. Novelist Rick Moody has cited the band as one of his influences.\n\nThe Feelies rarely worked with outside producers and created shimmering soundscapes with multiple guitar layers and percussion.{{says who?|date=May 2017}} They frequently played at Maxwell's, a live music venue and bar restaurant in Hoboken during the 1980s, often on national holidays.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Early history==\nThe band's name is taken from a fictional entertainment device described in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Glenn Mercer, Bill Million, Dave Weckerman and vocalist Richard Reilly began playing together in 1976 in Haledon, New Jersey in a band called the Outkids. The Outkids evolved into the Feelies with the addition of Vinny DeNunzio on drums and John Papesca on bass.\n\nIn 1978, the Village Voice dubbed the then-unsigned Feelies \"The Best Underground Band in New York\". With the line-up of Mercer, Million, Vinny DeNunzio's brother Keith DeNunzio on bass and Anton Fier on drums, the Feelies released their first single, \"Fa Cé-La\", on Rough Trade Records in 1979.\n\nThe Feelies' debut album, Crazy Rhythms, was released on Stiff Records in 1980, featuring the same line-up as on the \"Fa Cé-La\" Rough Trade single.\n\n==Earlier offshoots==\nAfter Crazy Rhythms, Fier and Keith DeNunzio left the band. With the Feelies in limbo, Mercer and Million collaborated with other local New Jersey musicians, forming one of a number of Feelies offshoots, The Trypes, featuring some once and future Feelies members, including Brenda Sauter, Dave Weckerman and Stanley Demeski, as well as John Baumgartner, Marc Francia and Toni Paruta. The Trypes, quieter and more psychedelic than the Feelies, played regular live gigs around the New York/Hoboken scene at clubs such as Maxwell's and Folk City. In 1984, Coyote Records released a Trypes 12\" EP produced by Million and Mercer, The Explorers Hold, featuring three original songs (credited to Mercer alone or with other band members), plus a cover of the George Harrison song, \"Love You To\", which originally had appeared on The Beatles' Revolver. The Trypes also contributed a Million/Mercer-produced original song, \"A Plan Revised\", to the 1985 Coyote anthology of Hoboken acts, Luxury Condos Coming To Your Neighborhood Soon. Some members of the Trypes later formed the band Speed The Plough.\n\nMillion, Mercer, Sauter, Demeski and Baumgartner also gigged around New York and Hoboken under the name, Yung Wu, which was fronted by and featured the songs of Feelies' percussionist Dave Weckerman, who also sang lead. Yung Wu released one album on Coyote Records in 1986, titled Shore Leave. It featured Weckerman originals, plus covers of \"Big Day\", \"Child of the Moon\", and \"Powderfinger\", a staple of their live gigs.\n\nThe Willies, also known as The Willies From Haledon, were yet another Feelies offshoot that played around the New York/Hoboken clubs in the early 1980s. The Willies shared a similar lineup as the later Feelies, but their live sets consisted mostly of cover songs, extended instrumentals and psychedelic jams, such as \"Third Stone From the Sun\" and \"Sedan Delivery\". The Feelies' appearance in Jonathan Demme's Something Wild was credited to the Willies.\n\n==Later Feelies==\nThe members of the Feelies never stopped playing and collaborating in the 1980s, earning them the distinction of being \"the New York area's best-loved underground rockers since the late 1970s\", according to Jon Pareles of the New York Times in 1986. The band occasionally even performed under the name \"The Feelies\", often on holidays at Maxwell's. At least one such gig featured a reunion of the Crazy Rhythms line-up of Million, Mercer, DeNunzio and Fier. By the late 1980s, the band re-emerged from their self-imposed exile with new members and their first new album in six years.\n\nReformed as a quintet featuring Mercer, Million, Weckerman, Sauter and Demeski, the Feelies recorded The Good Earth in 1985 with Peter Buck of R.E.M. on board as co-producer with Mercer and Million. The album was released in 1986 and featured ten original Mercer/Million compositions. The band toured in support of the album as an opening band for Lou Reed as well as R.E.M. that year.\n\nIn 1988, the Feelies signed to a major label and released the album Only Life on A&M Records. The lineup was the same as The Good Earth, and Mercer and Million again handled production duties. The disc was a critical favorite, coming in at No.&nbsp;27 on the Village Voice's 1988 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Recently, the album's title track has been used as the introductory music for the Harvard Business Review's HBR Idea Cast\n\nThe band's final album before a hiatus, Time for a Witness, was released on A&M in 1991. The album broke little new ground from Only Life but still earned the band critical praise.\n\nIn March 2011 The Feelies released an album entitled Here Before produced by Bill Million and Glenn Mercer, on the Bar/None record label. The band remains \"one of the nation's most beloved alternative-rock bands.\"\n\nThe Feelies sixth studio album, In Between, was released in February 2017, also on the Bar-None label. Reviews were generally favorable, with metacritic calculating an average critical rating of 81%.\n\n==Reunion==\nThe band played reunion shows in the summer and fall of 2008. A performance at Battery Park in NYC with Sonic Youth followed several warm-up shows at Maxwell's.\n\nIn June 2009, the band performed an acoustic show at the Whitney Museum. They also headlined a show at Millennium Park in Chicago.\n\nIn September 2009, they performed Crazy Rhythms live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.\n\nBar/None Records reissued Crazy Rhythms and The Good Earth on September 8, 2009. Domino Records will reissue both albums outside of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Feelies have reunited sporadically over the last two decades to play concerts at their early home at Maxwell's. The band most recently performed there for three consecutive nights on July 4–6, 2013.\n\n==Film appearances==\nThe band was featured in the 1986 Jonathan Demme movie, Something Wild playing a band at a high school reunion; however, they did not feature on the soundtrack. Credited as \"The Willies\", they performed bits of five songs, including \"Crazy Rhythms\" and \"Loveless Love\" as well as covers of David Bowie's \"Fame\" and the Monkees' \"I'm a Believer\" (written by Neil Diamond). The Feelies song \"Too Far Gone\" made it on to the soundtrack for the Demme film Married to the Mob. Million and Mercer were also brought together by director Susan Seidelman to create the score for her film, Smithereens. The song \"Let's Go\" from the band's second album \"Good Earth\" is featured on the soundtrack of Noah Baumbach's 2005 film \"The Squid and the Whale\".\n\n\"Loveless Love\" was used on the soundtrack of Olivier Assayas's 2010 film Carlos.\n\n==Side projects and alumni bands==\n*Wild Carnation featuring Brenda Sauter and her husband Richard Barnes (both also of Speed the Plough) has released two albums: Tricycle and Superbus.*Wake Ooloo featured Mercer and Weckerman, and released three albums with both Mercer and Weckerman on vocals.*Anton Fier formed The Golden Palominos and has toured with Bob Mould.*Stanley Demeski joined and toured with the band Luna*Demeski, Weckerman, and Mercer have been playing in a band called the Sunburst with former Speed The Plough members Marc Francia, Toni Paruta, and John Baumgartner.*Glenn Mercer's debut solo CD was released by Pravda Records in May 2007.

RED is a member of the Student Radio Association (SRA), and was nominated for best show in November 2007.\n\n==History==\nThe station was originally called University Radio Essex (URE), and was founded in 1971, making it one of the first student radio stations in the UK.\n\nIt was broadcast on 998&nbsp;kHz (301 metres) using a \"leaky cable\" system which ran through ducting in the 'six towers' of student residences and was designed to ensure it could not be heard off-campus.\n\nThe frequency changed to 999&nbsp;kHz with the realignment of medium wave broadcasting to 9&nbsp;kHz spacing, and in the 1980s it moved to 963&nbsp;kHz (312 metres). Unfortunately not long after, [Radio Caroline] re-appeared, broadcasting on the same wavelength from the Thames Estuary and URE was forced to move back to 999.\n\nIt was renamed \"RED AM 1404\" in 2001 (by the station committee), renamed to \"RED - 1404 AM\" in 2007, and simplified to RED Radio in 2008, when it stopped transmitting in AM.\n\nThe station originally had three studios, and in 1998 transmitted on FM for a month, this number was reduced to two in 2004, and then to only one, renovated in 2007.\n\nRED organises many events throughout term, including \"The End\": a BYOB and live music semi \"rave\", that occupies all 3 of the main squares of the University of Essex.\n\nRed Radio broadcasts during term time across the university campus and parts of Colchester on 1404AM/MW and over the internet. It was one of the first student radio stations in the UK to be licensed to broadcast on LPAM (instead of induction loops). It runs solely on the voluntary efforts of students, who dedicate their free time to keep it running, and the efforts of a part-time Station Manager, appointed by the University of Essex Students' Union. The decision to appoint a Station Manager was part of a process to have the UoE SU's Media Heads all be paid.\n\nThe station had a partial rebranding again in 2008 to overcome the problems with students not knowing what 'RED' was. The idea was to \"bring it into age\", dropping the 1404am and promoting the online aspects of the station, by marketing with the name and logo of 'RED Radio'.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.essexstudent.com/student_media/red/ Official Website]\n\n{{University of Essex}}{{Student radio in the United Kingdom}}\n\nCategory:University of EssexCategory:Student radio in the United KingdomCategory:Radio stations established in 1971","tags":["originally","of","the"],"dateCreated":1496681089591,"dateModified":1496681089591},{"id":12749271,"title":"Beddau RFC","text":"{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}{{Infobox rugby team | teamname = Beddau RFC | fullname = Beddau Rugby Football Club | location = Beddau, Wales | countryflag = Wales | founded = 1951/52 | ground = Mount Pleasant Park | capacity = | president = Unknown | coach = Lee Davies, Ben Daniels | captain = Glenn Slater | league = WRU Championship | season = 2015/16 | position = 2014/15 Swalec Division One East Central Champions | url = www.pitchero.com/clubs/beddaurfc/ | pattern_la1=| pattern_b1=_thinyellowsides| pattern_ra1=| leftarm1=008000| body1=008000| rightarm1=008000| shorts1=FFFFFF| socks1=008000}}Beddau Rugby Football Club is a rugby union team from the village of Beddau, South Wales. The present club was formed in 1951-52, but it can trace its roots to around 1900. Beddau RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for Cardiff Blues.\n\n==History==\nBeddau had a village rugby team from around 1900 until the Second World War. During the war all the club's records were destroyed apart from a few remaining photographs of Beddau RFC teams from the late 1930s.\n\nBeddau RFC was reformed in 1951-52 and has since been based in Castellau Road, Beddau. The club plays at Mount Pleasant Park, Beddau.\n\n==Today==\nToday, Beddau RFC plays in the WRU Championship. In the 2006-07 season, Beddau RFC won the Division One East League, but were denied promotion to the Premier League as their grounds were deemed not to meet WRU criteria. This ruling was upheld at an EGM by 67% of members.The Club was entered into the inaugural Swalec Championship and had several good seasons in the second WRU league tier before being relegated in 2013/14. In 2014/15 With new coaches Lee Davies and Ben Daniels at the helm the Green and Golds led by Glenn Slater bounced back immediately to the Championship winning the Division One East Central title in emphatic fashion, winning 21 out of their 22 fixtures and going unbeaten at home. Winning the league meant a Play-off game for promotion to the Championship against Penalta RFC which beddau won convincingly 22-13. \n\nThe Club has a thriving mini and junior section, excellent Youth team that all feeds into the Development XV and 1st XV.\n\n==Club honours==\n* Worthington's Mid District Cup 2007-08 - Winners* Swalec Division One East Champions 2014/15* WRU Division One East Champions - 2006-07* Mid District Cup 2006-07 - Winners* Mid District Cup 2005-06 - Winners* Mid District Cup 2004-05 - Winners* Mid District Cup 2003-04 - Winners* Glamorgan County Silver Ball Trophy 1989-90 - Winners* Mid District Cup 1970-71 - Winners\n\n==Notable former players==\n\n===Full Internationals===\n*Gary Protheroe (Wales and British Lions)*Steve Fenwick (Wales and British Lions)*Chris Bridges (Wales)*Andrew Lamerton (Wales)*Gareth Wyatt (Wales)*Michael Owen (Wales and British Lions)* Gemma Hallet (Wales Women)\n\n===Current Internationals===\n*Gethin Jenkins (Wales and British Lions)*Bradley Davies (Wales)*Tom Slater (Wales Sevens)* Tom Riley (Wales Sevens)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/beddaurfc/ Beddau Rugby Football Club]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rugby Wales links}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beddau Rfc}}Category:Welsh rugby union teams\n\n{{Wales-rugbyunion-team-stub}}","tags":["founded","Ben","the"],"dateCreated":1496681064923,"dateModified":1496681064923},{"id":1293765,"title":"SLG","text":"The initials SLG or S.L.G. may refer to:\n\n* Savoy Label Group, subsidiary of Columbia Music Entertainment* Sigma Lambda Gamma (ΣΛΓ), Latina-based sorority with multicultural membership* Sindicato Labrego Galego-Comisións Labregas, Galician peasants union* Slave Labor Graphics, independent comic book publisher* Slugging percentage, baseball statistic* Socialist Labour Group, Trotskyist political party that used to exist in Britain * Super League Greece, Greece's topflight soccer league* Proto SLG, paintball marker manufactured by DYE Precision, whereby \"SLG\" is short for \"Super Light Gun\"* SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE symbol:SLG), publicly traded real-estate investment trust in the US* Community of the Sisters of the Love of God, Anglican women's Community, with SLG Press as its publishing arm\n\n{{disambiguation}}","tags":["political","book","manufactured"],"dateCreated":1496681064907,"dateModified":1496681064907},{"id":14306965,"title":"Handball at the Asian Games","text":"Handball has been an Asian Games event since 1982 when the sport was first played in New Delhi, India.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Men===\n\n===Women===\n\n==Medal table==\n\n==Participating nations==\n\n===Men===\n\n===Women===\n\n==General statistics==\n===Men===\n\n===Women===\n\n==List of medalists==\n{{main|List of Asian Games medalists in handball}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.doha-2006.com/gis/menuroot/sports/Handball_HR.aspx-id=HB.html Medallists from previous Asian Games - Handball]\n\n{{Sports at the Asian Games}}{{Asian Games Handball}}{{International Handball}}\n\n Category:Sports at the Asian GamesAsian GamesAsian Games","tags":["Medallists","India","Games"],"dateCreated":1496680662181,"dateModified":1496680662181},{"id":1454931,"title":"Timeline of the invasion of Poland","text":"{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n\n== September ==\n\n:1: World War II begins with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.

It was originally released in 1994 as a single and the album version was not released until 1995 on their self-titled debut. \n\nThe song was the subject of controversy, due to its overt similarity to another band's work. The intro synthesizer part (later repeated as a guitar figure) is lifted from the guitar riff in Wire's \"Three Girl Rhumba\" and transposed down a semitone. A judgment resulted in an out-of-court settlement and the credits were rewritten.\n\nJonathan Perry writing for The Phoenix noted the similarities to Wire. He included the song in a list of the 90 best songs of the 90s, writing: \"'Connection,' Elastica's obsessively catchy stateside breakthrough, nicked its signature opening riff from Wire's 'Three Girl Rhumba' -- an overzealous (and uncredited) 'homage' that proved that though imitation may indeed be the highest form of flattery, it can also cost in publishing royalties. Great song, though.\" \n\nThe song is the theme to the UK television programme Trigger Happy TV. A live version of the song was featured on the MuchMusic live compilation album, Much at Edgefest '99.\n\nThe song was covered by Elastica's label-mates Collapsed Lung and released as a seven-inch vinyl single in 1995.\n\n==Charts==\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MetroLyrics song|elastica|connection}}\n\n{{Elastica}}\n\nCategory:1994 singlesCategory:1994 songsCategory:Elastica songs\n\n{{1990s-rock-song-stub}}","tags":["October","alternative","as"],"dateCreated":1496680662186,"dateModified":1496680662186},{"id":15105708,"title":"Mike Cacic","text":"{{Infobox gridiron football person|name=Mike Cacic|import=no|birth_date={{birth date|1937|1|4}}|birth_place= Vancouver, British Columbia|death_date={{death date and age|2008|1|22|1937|1|4}}|death_place= Surrey, British Columbia|position1=Defensive tackle|Height_ft=6|Height_in=4|Weight_lbs=260|College=|DraftedYear=|DraftedRound=|Awards=|Honors=|CFLAllStar={{CFL Year|1964}}|CFLWestAllStar={{CFL Year|1964}}, {{CFL Year|1965}}, {{CFL Year|1966}}|playing_years1={{CFL Year|1957}}–{{CFL Year|1958}}|playing_team1=BC Lions|playing_years2={{CFL Year|1960}}–{{CFL Year|1967}}|playing_team2=BC Lions|DatabaseFootball=|PFR=|CFHOF=}}\n\nMike Cacic (January 4, 1937 - January 22, 2008) was a former defensive lineman who played 10 years in the Canadian Football League for the British Columbia Lions from 1957 to 1967. Mike Cacic was born in Vancouver of Croatian heritage. Instead of college football, Cacic played in the junior league in the Lower Mainland near Vancouver, a member of the \"head hunters\" on defence. In his first years as a Lion, he was plagued by injuries. As a rookie in 1957, he missed the last 4 games due to an ankle injury. In his second year, he tore ligaments in his knee and so missed the last 4 games in addition to the entire 1959 season. However, starting in 1960, he played all 16 games for 5 out of 6 years and was a western conference all-star from 1964 to 1966. He was part of the Grey cup winning team of 1964. He retired in 1967.\n\nAt the end of his career, Cacic was named to the B.C. Lions 50th Anniversary Dream Team and the BC Lions Wall of Fame. His post football career involved working for the New Westminster, B.C. School board. He spent most of life living in Surrey, B.C.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.footballforum.com/bc-lions/87928-lions-mourn-loss-mike-cacic.html Obituary]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|1}}\n\n{{52nd Grey Cup}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cacic, Mike}}Category:1937 birthsCategory:2008 deathsCategory:BC Lions playersCategory:Canadian football defensive linemenCategory:Canadian people of Croatian descentCategory:Grey Cup championsCategory:People from Surrey, British ColumbiaCategory:Players of Canadian football from British ColumbiaCategory:Sportspeople from Vancouver\n\n{{Canadianfootball-defensive-lineman-stub}}","tags":["Columbia","in","Vancouver"],"dateCreated":1496681064944,"dateModified":1496681064944},{"id":16273214,"title":"3d Space Experimentation Squadron","text":"{{Infobox military unit|unit_name= 3d Space Experimentation Squadron|image=3d Space Experimentation Squadron.PNG|caption= 3d Space Experimentation Squadron emblem|dates= 1990-2002; 2006–Present|country= United States|allegiance=|branch= United States Air Force|type= Space Control|role= Experimentation|size=|command_structure=AFSPC/21st Space Wing|current_commander= |garrison= Schriever AFB, Colorado|ceremonial_chief=|colonel_of_the_regiment=|nickname=|patron=|motto=Unequalled excellence|colors=|march=|mascot=|battles=|anniversaries=|decorations= AFOUA}}\n\nThe 3d Space Experimentation Squadron (3 SES) is a space control unit located at Schriever AFB in Colorado.\n\n==Mission==\nThe 3d Space Experimentation Squadron is AFSPC's premier organization for space-based demonstrations, pathfinders and experiments. The unit identifies concepts of employment, training, education and technical skill sets required to field selected future AFSPC missions. The 3d SES will develop a core cadre of space professionals to serve as subject matter experts for all future AFSPC space-based endeavors, demonstrate operational utility of selected demonstrations and apply lessons learned from demonstrations and pathfinders for use in future initiatives.\n\n==History==\nThe 3d SES was first constituted as the 3d Surveillance Squadron on August 10, 1990, at Misawa AB, Japan. However it was not activated at that time. In preparation for its activation and operations, Det. 3, 73d Space Group activated in January 1991 to oversee construction and site preparation for the 3d. The home for the 3d SS (project name RINGO) was completed on March 16, 1991. Two antennas, an operations building, support building, pump housing and entry control point were constructed beginning on October 1, 1991, and was completed on May 31, 1992. Later that year, the unit was redesignated 3d Space Surveillance Squadron and it activated on October 1. The unit's Deep Space Tracking System obtained initial operating capability in April 1994. The squadron inactivated on February 20, 2002.\n\nAssigned to the 73d Space Group, the 3d was tasked with operating passive sensors for the Deep Space Tracking System. The squadron was one of two Deep Space Tracking System squadrons located throughout the world. The DSTS tracked objects orbiting more than 22,300 miles above the Earth. More than 9,500 man-made objects orbit the Earth, ranging in size from a baseball to the Mir space station. The 3d SPSS forwarded this data to the 1st Command and Control Squadron and the Space Control Center, Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, CO. The 1st CACS and the center use this information, along with other data, to catalog and identify all man-made Earth-orbiting objects. Several agencies use this information for everything from collision avoidance to intelligence.\n\nOn February 23, 2006, Air Force Space Command ordered the unit redesignated 3d Space Experimentation Squadron and activated it effective March 10, 2006, with its new home at Schriever AFB, Colorado.\n\n===Lineage===\n* Constituted as 3d Surveillance Squadron on 10 Aug 1990: Re-designated: 3d Space Surveillance Squadron on 1 October 1992: Activated on 1 October 1992: Inactivated on 20 February 2002: Re-designated: 3d Space Experimentation Squadron on 16 February 2006: Activated on 10 March 2006\n\n===Assignments===\n* 73d Space Group, 1 October 1992 – 25 April 1995* 21st Operations Group 26 April 1995 – 20 February 2002* 595th Space Group, 10 March 2006 – 30 March 2013* 50th Operations Group, 1 April 2013-\n\n===Detachments===\n*Detachment 1, 3d Space Surveillance Squadron - Osan AB, Republic of Korea\n\n===Stations===\n* Misawa AB, Japan (1 Oct 1992–20 Feb 2002)* Schriever AFB, Colorado (10 Mar 2006 – present)\n\n===Space Systems===\n* Deep Space Tracking System (1992–2002)\n\n===Commanders===\n*Lt Col Joseph Prue *Lt Col Jeff Hokett*Lt Col Jim Maestas*Lt Col Richard Lucas (Misawa)*Lt Col Robert Preston (Misawa - 1st Commander)\n\n===Decorations===\n*Air Force Outstanding Unit Award File:Outstanding Unit ribbon.svg**1 Jan 2000-31 Aug 2001**1 Jan 1999-31 Dec 1999**1 Jan 1998-31 Dec 1998**1 Oct 1997-30 Sep 1999**1 Oct 1995-30 Sep 1997\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|World War II|United States Air Force|Military of the United States}}{{AFHRA}}{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{USAF Space Command}}\n\nCategory:Military units and formations in ColoradoSpace Experimentation 0003","tags":["to","professionals","sets"],"dateCreated":1496680662174,"dateModified":1496680662174},{"id":16332697,"title":"V26","text":"V26, or similar may refer to:* Fokker V.26, a German World War I fighter aircraft prototype* Twenty-five V 26, a Dailmer straight-eight automobile engine* V.26, a telecommunications recommendation of the ITU-T\n\n{{Letter-NumberCombDisambig}}","tags":["may","telecommunications","straighteight"],"dateCreated":1496681064957,"dateModified":1496681064957},{"id":16846960,"title":"USP51","text":"{{Multiple issues|{{Underlinked|date=June 2016}}{{Orphan|date=February 2009}}}}\n\n{{Infobox_gene}}Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 51 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the USP51 gene.{{PBB_Summary| section_title = | summary_text = }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin | 2}}{{PBB_Further_reading | citations = *{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross MT, Grafham DV, Coffey AJ, etal |title=The DNA sequence of the human X chromosome. |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue= 7031 |pages= 325–37 |year= 2005 |pmid= 15772651 |doi= 10.1038/nature03440 | pmc=2665286 }}*{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerhard DS, Wagner L, Feingold EA, etal |title=The status, quality, and expansion of the NIH full-length cDNA project: the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC). |journal=Genome Res. |volume=14 |issue= 10B |pages= 2121–7 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15489334 |doi= 10.1101/gr.2596504 | pmc=528928 }}*{{cite journal | vauthors=Puente XS, López-Otín C |title=A genomic analysis of rat proteases and protease inhibitors. |journal=Genome Res. |volume=14 |issue= 4 |pages= 609–22 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15060002 |doi= 10.1101/gr.1946304 | pmc=383305 }}*{{cite journal |vauthors=Xie H, Diber A, Pollock S, etal |title=Bridging expressed sequence alignments through targeted cDNA sequencing. |journal=Genomics |volume=83 |issue= 4 |pages= 572–6 |year= 2004 |pmid= 15028280 |doi= 10.1016/j.ygeno.2003.07.003 }}*{{cite journal |vauthors=Quesada V, Díaz-Perales A, Gutiérrez-Fernández A, etal |title=Cloning and enzymatic analysis of 22 novel human ubiquitin-specific proteases. |journal=Biochem.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Voio, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit. It lies {{convert|28|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of Kozani. The municipal unit has an area of 158.524 km<sup>2</sup>, the community 94.426 km<sup>2</sup>. The 2011 census recorded 5,490 residents in the town and 6,247 in the municipal unit. It was built on the austral slope of the Velia mountain on an (average) height of {{convert|930|m|0|abbr=off}}. The first name of the city was Kalyvia, because the city was known for its huts. This name is referenced in the archives of the Zavordas Monastery.\n\n==Administrative division==\nThe municipal unit of Siatista consists of the following municipal communities (populations as of 2011):*Siatista, population 5,490*Mikrokastro, population 446*Palaiokastro, population 311The municipal community of Palaiokastro comprises two settlements: Palaiokastro and Dafnero.\n\n==History==\nIn 1745, the city is referenced in a formal document of Joseph, Patriarch of Ohrid. The commercial ties between Siatista and many European countries during 17th and 18th centuries were very successful, and allowed the inhabitants to build many mansions and churches with wonderful frescos and icons.\n\nSiatista lies in a unique setting where its mountains and wilderness provide a strong sense of solitude. As a result, many Siatistan had to become merchants as to import (or export) necessary goods. Many of them found their way abroad permanently or temporarily where they distinguished themselves as able and reliable merchants. Many of them who became wealthy never return in their town staying for ever in the big cities all over the Balkan Peninsula. Those who choose to return built large and elegant mansions distinguished by their thick walls, imposing doors, lavishly decorated \"ondas\", gorgeous stained glasses, and lively colours in the folk paintings on their walls. All of this embodies their high standard of living, a rather rare phenomenon for such an isolated town. Many of those mansions are still in good shape today in the old city.\n\nOne of such a self-made wealthy merchants was Theodoros Dimitriou who together with his wife Afrati left their town at 1790 for Zagreb, then an Austro-Hungarian city. He managed to earn a significant fortune by trading a variety of goods which helped them to give a proper education to their children. Of them, Dimitrios destined to become a famous and celebrated personality for his role as a leading figure in the movement for the national awakening of the Croatian people (then under Austro-Hungarian rule) as a national writer, poet, dramatist and political activist. Recognized as one of the most learned people of his time, he was the first who imposed the Croatian language in the local literacy, he created the National Croatian Theater in Zagreb and became famous for his political activism for the Croatian national revival through his key role in many Croatian patriotic pamphlets at the time. Demeter's award for drama which established 35 years after his death (1872) stood until nowadays and his bust decorates the yard of the Croatian National Theater in Zagreb.\n\nIn 1888 Ioannes Trampatzes, another expatriate Greek merchant, this one in Romania, donated the funds for the Trampatzeion Gymnasium. The gymnasium housed two large libraries, the Manouseios with 5,000 books and the Roussopouleios with 2,000.\n\nSiatista was liberated from the Ottoman Turks by the Greek army, on November 4, 1912 during the First Balkan War.\n\n==Celebrations==\n*August 15 - Assumption of Mary - The male inhabitants of Siatista parade with their horses down to a chapel in the plain and return with the icon of the Panagia. In the feast and party that ensues the men dance on the backs of their horses. The local wine flows freely, even for their equine friends.*December 23 - Κλαδαριές (Klatharies) - On this day the inhabitants gather brush from the surrounding area. Each neighbourhood group builds tall, (three to six metres), conical shaped mounds that are decorated sparsely with balloons and tinsel. After nightfall a parade, including a brass band playing local music, begins at the lower town, Γεράνια (Yerania). In succession each mound of brush is set afire as the parade reaches the neighbourhood. The inhabitants then dance around the fires. Many of the village youth then stay up all night around the remnants of the bonfires to start carolling early in the morning of Christmas Eve, collecting money while singing door to door.\n\n==Notable people==\n*Michail Papageorgiou\n\n==See also==\n*Ecclesiastical Museum of Siatista*Paleontological Museum of Siatista\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.siatista.gr Siatista]*[http://www.www.siatistanews.gr Siatista News]\n\n{{Voio div}}\n\nCategory:Populated places in Kozani (regional unit)Category:Former municipalities in Western Macedonia","tags":["residents","municipal","convertkmabbroff"],"dateCreated":1496681089576,"dateModified":1496681089576},{"id":18553128,"title":"Renewable energy law in Pennsylvania","text":"Pennsylvania approved a bill that establishes a $500 million fund to support renewable energy projects. Special Session House Bill 1 authorizes the Commonwealth Financing Authority to borrow $500 million, most of which will be split into six funding sources relating to energy efficiency and renewable energy: $80 million in grants and loans for solar energy projects; $100 million in grants, loans, and rebates for up to 35% of the cost of solar energy projects at residences and small businesses; $165 million in grants and loans for alternative energy projects, excluding solar energy, at businesses and local government facilities; $25 million for wind and geothermal energy projects; $40 million to help start-up businesses involved in energy efficiency technologies; and $25 million in grants and loans to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing homes and small business buildings. An additional $65 million will go toward pollution control technologies and to help low-income families pay their energy bills.\n\nIn addition to the $500 million fund, the bill creates a Consumer Energy Program that is funded at $15 million for the next 3 fiscal years, then gradually decreases to $8 million by the 2015–2016 fiscal year, for a total of $100 million. Of that, $92.5 million will support loans, grants, and rebates for up to 25% of the cost of energy efficiency improvements to homes and small businesses, while $5 million will support low-interest loans for energy efficiency improvements to homes. An additional $50 million will be available over the next 8 years to support tax credits for 15% of the cost of alternative energy projects, capped at $1 million per year for each project.\n\n==Biofuels==\nGovernor Edward Rendell also approved two bills on July 10, 2008 that relate to biofuels.\n\nHouse Bill 1202 could add as much as {{convert|1|e9USgal|m3}} of advanced biofuels to the state's fuel supply. It requires all retail diesel fuel sold in the state to contain 2% biodiesel, once the in-state production of biodiesel reaches {{convert|40|e6USgal|m3}} per year, increasing incrementally to a 20% biodiesel requirement, once the in-state production of biodiesel reaches {{convert|400|e6USgal|m3}} per year (but only if vehicle manufacturers approve the use of 20% biodiesel). Likewise, all retail gasoline sold in the state must contain 10% ethanol, once the in-state production of cellulosic ethanol reaches {{convert|350|e6USgal|m3}} per year. The state already has a biodiesel production capacity of {{convert|60|e6USgal|m3}} per year, so the 2% biodiesel requirement could go into effect soon, if production is high enough.\n\nTo encourage biodiesel production, Special Session Senate Bill 22 will offer a subsidy of 75 cents per gallon of biodiesel produced, capped at $1.9 million per year for each producer. The bill also expands a hybrid vehicle rebate program to include plug-in hybrids and other alternative fuel vehicles.\n\n==See also==\n* Energy law* List of power stations in Pennsylvania* Wind power in Pennsylvania* Law of Pennsylvania\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\nCategory:Energy lawCategory:Renewable energy in the United StatesCategory:Renewable energy lawCategory:Pennsylvania lawCategory:Energy infrastructure in Pennsylvania","tags":["a","most","to"],"dateCreated":1496681089591,"dateModified":1496681089591},{"id":19404128,"title":"Letov Š-39","text":"__NOTOC__\n\nThe Letov Š-39 was a sport aircraft produced in Czechoslovakia during the 1930s. It was a conventional, parasol-wing monoplane with fixed tailskid undercarriage, and seating for the pilot and passenger in tandem, open cockpits. Because the cabane struts were very short, and the wing therefore placed very close to the top of the fuselage, the cockpits had the unusual arrangement of the passenger's being in front of the wing while the pilot's was behind it. The outer half of each wing was fitted with fixed slats along the leading edge. An initial batch of 23 machines was built for use by Czech aeroclubs. These were followed by batches of aircraft with alternative powerplants.\n\n==Variants==\n;Š-39:Prototype with Orion LL-50 engine followed by production batch with Walter Polaris engines;Š-139:Production model with Pobjoy R engine and Townend ring;Š-239:Production model with Walter Minor 4 engine\n\n==Specifications (Š-39)==\n{{aerospecs|ref=|met or eng?=met\n\n|crew=One pilot|capacity=1 passenger|length m=6.14|length ft=20|length in=2|span m=10.00|span ft=32|span in=10|swept m=|swept ft=|swept in=|rot number=|rot dia m=|rot dia ft=|rot dia in=|dia m=|dia ft=|dia in=|width m=|width ft=|width in=|height m=|height ft=|height in=|wing area sqm=14.0|wing area sqft=151|swept area sqm=|swept area sqft=|rot area sqm=|rot area sqft=|volume m3=|volume ft3=|aspect ratio=|wing profile=|empty weight kg=315|empty weight lb=693|gross weight kg=515|gross weight lb=1,133|lift kg=|lift lb=\n\n|eng1 number=1|eng1 type=Walter Polaris|eng1 kw=41|eng1 hp=55|eng1 kn=|eng1 lbf=|eng1 kn-ab=|eng1 lbf-ab=|eng2 number=|eng2 type=|eng2 kw=|eng2 hp=|eng2 kn=|eng2 lbf=|eng2 kn-ab=|eng2 lbf-ab=\n\n|max speed kmh=150|max speed mph=94|max speed mach=|cruise speed kmh=|cruise speed mph=|stall speed kmh=|stall speed mph=|range km=480|range miles=300|endurance h=|endurance min=|ceiling m=3,300|ceiling ft=10,800|g limits=|roll rate=|glide ratio=|climb rate ms=2.1|climb rate ftmin=410|sink rate ms=|sink rate ftmin=\n\n|armament1=|armament2=|armament3=|armament4=|armament5=|armament6=}}{{aircontent|see also=|related=|similar aircraft=|lists=}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Letov aircraft}}* {{cite book |last= Taylor |first= Michael J.

As a young man, \"Maurie\" Sheehy (as he was then known) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood in the Victorian Football League (VFL). As an older gentleman, Sheehy was a politician, better known as Patrick Sheehy.\n\n==Sports notoriety==\nSheehy began his sports career at Collingwood in 1914. After just two games he crossed to Fairfield where he spent the 1915 football season. The Northcote District recruit returned to Collingwood the following year and went on to appear in four Grand Finals. A back pocket in their 1919 premiership team, Sheehy also participated in the club's losing 1918, 1920 and 1922 Grand Final sides. He left Collingwood to coach Northcote in 1923.\n\n==Political career==\nSheehy joined the Australian Labor Party in 1911. He was a Richmond, Australia city councillor (1934-1956); and twice mayor (from 1941–42 and 1951–52).\n\nSheehy had also contested the federal seat of Kooyong as the Australian Labor Party candidate in 1951, losing to the incumbent Robert Menzies.\n\nSheehy was elected to the Victorian State Legislative Council for the seat of Melbourne in June 1952, and served until his defeat in June 1958. He represented the Labor Party from 21 June 1952 until March 1955. When the party split in March 1955, Sheehy became a member of the Democratic Labor Party (or the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist) as it was originally known) until his defeat on 20 June 1958.\n\nSheehy was a Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works Commissioner from 1950 until 1956, and he also served for a time as a member of the Richmond Girls' Secondary School Council.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).

He currently leads a re-formed Beat line-up with drummer Everett Morton.\n\nThe \"Ranking\" moniker is short for \"Top Ranking\" or \"High Ranking,\" and is a boast typical of many MCs.\n\nRoger was born in Birmingham, England, the son of Jean Baptiste Charlery. He became a punk rock fan as a teenager and joined ska revival pioneers The Beat in the late 1970s. He had appeared on stage toasting and singing with them many times before officially joining the band. His energetic style and Jamaican-influenced vocals, paired with Dave Wakeling were crucial in distinguishing the band from the other second-wave ska bands. The Beat released three albums: the critically acclaimed and seminal I Just Can't Stop It (1980), Wha'ppen? (1981) and Special Beat Service (1982).\n\nAfter The Beat's 1983 break-up, he and Wakeling formed General Public with Mickey Billingham and Andy \"Stoker\" Growcott of Dexys Midnight Runners and Horace Panter of The Specials. They released the album All the Rage, aided by the single \"Tenderness\". In 1986 they released Hand to Mouth which was significantly less successful, and the band soon split up.\n\nIn 1995 Roger and Wakeling reformed General Public with a new supporting band, and released the album \"Rub It Better\". Roger and Wakeling also worked on various projects and reunited for the Threesome soundtrack, recording a cover of \"I'll Take You There\".\n\nRoger has also released two solo albums. 1988's Radical Departure album included band members Horace Panter and Fuzz Townshend. On 2001's Inside my Head album, Roger pursued a more dance/electronic sound, including the song \"Muscle Ska\" that was co-written with Neville Staple of The Specials.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Roger joined members of The Specials to form the new band Special Beat which released two live albums. In 1996 Roger sang back-up and toasting on the new version of \"The Bed's Too Big Without You\" on Sting's \"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\" CD-Maxi single. The rock band Smash Mouth featured Roger on their song \"You Are My Number One\" in 2003.\n\nRoger collaborated with Pato Banton in 1987 on the song \"Pato and Roger Come Again\". Included on Banton's album Never Give In, the song was a follow-up to an earlier collaboration by the two singers on \"Pato and Roger a Go Talk\", which appeared on Special Beat Service. Roger joined Banton again in 1995 on \"Bubbling Hot\", which reached #15 on the UK single charts.\n\nRanking Roger's son, Matthew Murphy – 'Ranking Junior', has followed in his father's footsteps. In 2005, he appeared on The Ordinary Boys' hit single \"Boys Will Be Boys\". In 2003, The Beat's original line-up, minus Cox and Steele, played a sold-out one-off gig at the Royal Festival Hall.In 2005, The Beat re-formed, counting Roger and Everett Morton of the original line-up, with Ranking Junior also on vocals. The Beat performed at Glastonbury the same year with new material written by Ranking Junior. The band is said to have the blessing of Cox, Steele and Saxa.\n\nRoger appeared on two tracks 'Future Dub' and 'Come Around' from the 2008/9 album 'Turning Point' by Snakestyle.\n\nRoger sang on \"Roxanne\" on stage with The Police on their 2007 world tour, and has regularly recorded with Sting.\n\nHe was also a guest performer on Big Audio Dynamite's seventh album, Higher Power, in 1994, when the band were known as simply 'Big Audio'. He later became a member of Big Audio Dynamite for their final studio album Entering a New Ride (1997).\n\nRoger has four sisters: Greta, Annie, Sandra, and Equilar, who was a backing singer for him. He also has a half brother and sister, Kevin and Sarah Charlery.\n\n==Discography==\nRadical Departure (1988 I.R.S.

A total of 15 teams competed in the championship, with Ballyhale Shamrocks unseating the two-time defending champions Portumna by 1–19 to 0–17 in the final at Croke Park, Dublin. The championship began on 11 October 2009 and concluded on 17 March 2010.\n\n==Pre-championship==\n\nThe build-up to the opening of the championship was dominated by Portumna and the possibility that they would become the first club to win three All-Ireland titles in-a-row, and a remarkable fourth in five championship seasons. Having secured their fifth county title since 2003, Portumna were only two games away from imoortality. The club had already come to be regarded as possibly the greatest club side of all-time. Winning an elusive three-in-a-row would close the argument on club hurling's greatest team.\n\nBallyhale Shamrocks were regarded as the primary challengers to Portumna's stranglehold on the championship. They entered the competition having captured their fourth county title and were hoping to become the first club to win five All-Ireland titles. Similarly, they were hoping to exact revenge on Portumna who dished out a 5–11 to 1–16 trouncing in the previous year's semi-final.\n\n==The championship==\n\n===Participating counties===\n\n===Format===\n\nThe 2009–10 club championship was run on a provincial basis as usual. It was a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random in the respective provinces – there were no seeds.\n\nEach match was played as a single leg. If a match was drawn there was a replay. If that match ended in a draw a period of extra time was played, however, if both sides were still level at the end of extra time another replay would take place.\n\nLeinster Championship\n\nQuarter-finals: (2 matches) These were two lone matches between the first four teams drawn from the province of Leinster.\n\nSemi-finals: (2 matches) The winners of the two quarter-finals joined the other two Munster teams to make up the semi-final pairings.\n\nFinal: (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contested this game.\n\nMunster Championship\n\nQuarter-final: (1 match) This was a single match between the first two teams drawn from the province of Munster.\n\nSemi-finals: (2 matches) The winner of the lone quarter-final joined the other three Munster teams to make up the semi-final pairings.\n\nFinal: (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contested this game.\n\nUlster Championship\n\nSemi-finals: (1 match) This was a single match between the first two teams drawn from the province of Ulster.\n\nFinal: (1 match) The winner of the lone semi-final joined another Ulster team, who received a bye to the final, to make up the final pairings.\n\nAll-Ireland Series\n\nSemi-finals: (2 matches) The four provincial champions contested these games.\n\nFinal: (1 match) The two semi-final winners contested the final.\n\n==Fixtures==\n\n===Ulster Senior Club Hurling Championship===\n{{footballbox|date= 2009-10-11<br>Semi-final|team1 = Ballycran|score = 2–17 – 2–13|report = [http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/dungiven-have-no-answer-to-wilsons-accuracy-1910792.html (report)]|team2 = Kevin Lynch's|goals1 = J Coyle 2–5, S Wilson 0–8 (1 '65', 0–7 frees), A Clarke 0–2, P Keith, G Savage 0–1 each.|goals2 = C Herron 0–4 (0-3f), K Hinphey 0–4, L Craig, P McCloskey 1–0 each, A McCloskey, P Kelly 0–2 each, L Hinphey 0–1.|stadium = Casement Park, Belfast|referee = D.

He was from Gushi in modern-day Henan.{{Chinese|t=王審知|s=王审知|poj=Ông Sím-ti|buc=Uòng Sīng-dĭ}}\n\n== Background ==\nWang Shenzhi was born in 862, during the reign of Emperor Yizong. His fifth-generation ancestor Wang Ye (王曄) served as the magistrate of Gushi County (固始, in modern Xinyang, Henan), and because the people loved him, he settled his family in Gushi. The family subsequently became known for their family business. His father's name was Wang Nin (王恁), and his mother was a Lady Dong. He had two older brothers, Wang Chao and Wang Shengui (王審邽).\n\n== Service under Wang Xu ==\nIn 881, the bandit leader Wang Xu, along with his brother-in-law Liu Xingquan (劉行全), captured Guang Prefecture (光州, in modern Xinyang); he was subsequently commissioned the prefect of Guang Prefecture by Qin Zongquan the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). Wang Xu forced the men of Guang Prefecture to join his army, and he made Wang Chao, who had previously been a government worker at the Gushi County government, his discipline officer. Later on, however, Qin turned against the Tang imperial government and was on the cusp of claiming imperial title himself. He ordered Wang Xu to pay taxes to him. When Wang Xu was unable to do so, he launched an army to attack Wang. Wang Xu, in fear, gathered 5,000 soldiers from Guang and Shou Prefectures and forced the people to cross the Yangtze River to the south. By spring 885, Wang had continued south and captured Ting (汀洲, in modern Longyan, Fujian) and Zhang (漳州, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures, but was not able to hold either for long. By the time that Wang Xu reached Zhang Prefecture, his army was running low on food. As the terrain in Fujian Circuit (福建, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian), which Zhang Prefecture belonged to, was rugged, he ordered that the old and the weak be abandoned. However, in violation of his order, Wang Chao and his brothers continued to take their mother Lady Dong with them. Wang Xu rebuked them and threatened to put Lady Dong to death. They begged for Lady Dong's life, offering to die in her stead. Other officers also spoke on their behalf, and Wang Xu relented.\n\nMeanwhile, by this point, Wang Xu had also become extremely paranoid, as he had been warned by a sorcerer that there was qi belonging to a king in his army, so he began to put to death anyone whom he considered to have talents surpassing his own — going as far as putting Liu Xingquan to death. The fact that Wang was willing to put someone as close to him as Liu to death terrified the other officers. When the army reached Na'an (南安, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), Wang Chao persuaded Wang Xu's forward commander, who feared that he would be Wang Xu's next target, into turning against Wang Xu. The forward commander and Wang Chao thus laid an ambush for Wang Xu and, when he was caught off-guard, arrested him. Wang Chao initially wanted to support the forward commander to be the new leader, but the forward commander pointed out that it was Wang Chao's idea that allowed them to survive Wang Xu's cruelty, and so the army agreed to have Wang Chao become their leader. Wang Chao subsequently took over Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and obtained a commission from Chen Yan the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Fujian Circuit (福建, headquartered in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) as the prefect of Quan Prefecture.\n\n== Service under Wang Chao ==\nIn 891, Chen Yan grew deathly ill. Chen sent an order to Wang Chao, summoning him to the circuit capital Fu Prefecture (福州), intending to entrust the matters of the circuit to him. Before he could depart, however, Chen died, and Chen's brother-in-law Fan Hui (范暉) got the soldiers at Fu Prefecture to support him as acting governor to resist Wang. Fan, however, soon lost the support of the soldiers, and Wang Chao sent his cousin Wang Yanfu (王彥復) and Wang Shenzhi as Wang Yanfu's deputy to lead an army to attack Fu Prefecture. However, they could not capture it quickly, and Fan sought aid from Dong Chang the military governor of Weisheng Circuit (威勝, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), who dispatched an army to aid him. Hearing that news, Wang Yanfu and Wang Shengui submitted a report to Wang Chao, requesting to withdraw. Wang Chao refused. When they requested that he come to the front to oversee the attack, he responded:\n\n{{quote|If soldiers die, I will replace the soldiers. If the generals die, I will replace the generals. If the soldiers and the generals all are dead, I will go myself.}}\n\nWang Yanfu and Wang Shenzhi, fearful of the rebuke, intensified their attacks. By summer 893, the food supply in Fu Prefecture ran out. Fan abandoned it and fled, and the Weisheng army, still on the way, hearing that Fan had fled, returned to Weisheng. Fan was killed by his soldiers in flight. Wang entered Fu Prefecture and claimed the title of acting governor. After Wang Chao was subsequently made governor of Fujian, and then the military governor (with the circuit's name upgraded from Fujian to Weiwu (威武)), Wang Shenzhi served as deputy military governor. It was said that whenever Wang Shenzhi had faults, Wang Chao would batter him, but Wang Shenzhi would not complain. In 897, when Wang Chao grew ill, he did not try to pass his authorities to any of his sons; rather, he entrusted the matters of the circuit to Wang Shenzhi. After Wang Chao died around the new year 898, Wang Shenzhi offered the authorities to Wang Shengui, who was then the prefect of Quan Prefecture, but Wang Shengui declined on the account that he considered Wang Shenzhi more accomplished. Wang Shenzhi thus claimed the title of acting military governor of Weiwu and submitted a report of what occurred to then-ruling Emperor Zhaozong, who commissioned him as acting military governor and later in the year made him full military governor.\n\n== As military governor of Weiwu ==\nIn 900, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事) on Wang Shenzhi. He was later successively given the honorary titles of acting Sikong (司空) and acting Situ (司徒) (two of the Three Excellencies). In 902, Wang built an outer wall for Fu Prefecture. In 904, Emperor Zhaozong created him the Prince of Langye.\n\nIn 907, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. Wang Shenzhi recognized the new emperor, and was subsequently given the greater chancellor title of Shizhong (侍中). In 909, Emperor Taizu created him the Prince of Min, and also gave him the chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (中書令).\n\n== As Prince of Min ==\n\n=== Early reign ===\nMeanwhile, also in 909, after Wang Shenzhi felt slighted by Zhang Zhiyuan (張知遠), the emissary from Hongnong (predecessor state to Wu, then ruled by Yang Wo the Prince of Hongnong, who did not recognize the Later Liang emperor), Wang decapitated Zhang and broke off diplomatic relations with Hongnong.\n\nAs prince, Wang was said to be frugal, often wearing hemp shoes, with his mansion remaining small and unexpanded. His criminal penalties were relaxed and tax rates were low; these policies were said to lead to both the government and the people becoming wealthy, and his realm to be calm. He submitted yearly tributes to the Later Liang emperor by sea route, via Later Liang's Deng (登州) and Lai (萊州, both in modern Yantai, Shandong) Prefectures, but the sea route was said to be so treacherous that 40–50% casualties were common.\n\nIn 916, Wang Shenzhi gave a daughter to Qian Chuanxiang (錢傳珦, later known as Qian Yuanxiang (錢元珦)), the son of Qian Liu, the prince of Min's neighbor to the north, Wuyue, in marriage. Qian Chuanxiang personally went to Min for the marriage, and it was said that after the wedding, the relationship between Min and Wuyue became more friendly. Also in 916, Wang Shenzhi began to make lead coins, and thereafter, lead coins were circulated along with the traditional copper coins.\n\n=== Late reign ===\nIn 917, Wang Shenzhi took Liu Hua, a niece of Liu Yan, the emperor of Min's southwestern neighbor Yue (which would later be known as Southern Han), whose title was Princess of Qingyuan, as the wife of his second son Wang Yanjun. (Written historical accounts indicated that she was a daughter of Liu Yan's, but her tombstone was subsequently discovered, revealing that she was actually the daughter of Liu Yan's older brother and predecessor, Liu Yin.)\n\nIn 918, Wu, which was then ruled by Yang Wo's brother and successor Yang Longyan, launched a major attack, commanded by the general Liu Xin (劉信), on Tan Quanbo the military governor of Baisheng Circuit (百勝, headquartered in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi), who was ruling the circuit in independence but whose nominal allegiance had vacillated between Wu and Later Liang. Tan sought aid from Min, as well as Wuyue and Chu. Min forces advanced to Yudu (雩都, in modern Ganzhou) to try to aid Tan, while Wuyue and Chu also sent troops. After Liu then defeated Chu troops, Min and Wuyue forces also withdrew. Subsequently, Liu captured Tan's capital Qian Prefecture (虔州), allowing Wu to directly take over Baisheng Circuit.\n\nApparently sometime after Wang Shengui's death (the date of which was not recorded in traditional histories, but appeared to be 903), Wang Shenzhi allowed Wang Shengui's son Wang Yanbin (王延彬) to take over governance of Quan Prefecture, and later bestowed on him the title of military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, whose territory was not under Min control, being headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong). Wang Yanbin initially governed the prefecture well. However, later, after he received a white deer and a purple lingzhi, he became arrogant, believing in the prophecies of the Buddhist monk Haoyuan (浩源) that he would become prince in the future. He further secretly sent emissaries to Later Liang, seeking to be a Later Liang vassal independently of Wang Shenzhi. When Wang Shenzhi discovered this in 920, he had Haoyuan and his associates executed and removed Wang Yanbin from his posts, sending him back to his mansion.\n\nIn 922, there was an incident where Liu Yan (whose state had been renamed Han by that point and thereafter was known as Southern Han in traditional Chinese sources), believing in sorcerers who told him that he should go to Meikou (梅口, in modern Meizhou, Guangdong) to avoid a disaster. With Meikou on the border between Southern Han and Min, the Min general Wang Yanmei (王延美), who might have been either a son of Wang Shenzhi's or Yang Shengui's, decided to launch an ambush on Liu. However, Liu received news of the ambush and left Meikou before Min forces could attack.\n\nIn 923, Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin, whose state was a rival of Later Liang's to its north, declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong), and later that year captured Later Liang's capital Daliang. The Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen (son of Emperor Taizu) committed suicide), ending Later Liang. Subsequently, emissaries were exchanged between Min and Later Tang, and Wang Shenzhi recognized Emperor Zhuangzong's suzerainty.\n\nIn 924, Southern Han launched an attack on Min, with Liu Yan himself commanding the troops and reaching the borders of Min's Ting and Zhang Prefectures. A Min counterattack defeated Southern Han forces, however, and Liu Yan withdrew.\n\nIn 925, Wang Shenzhi grew ill, and he put his oldest son Wang Yanhan, then the deputy military governor of Weiwu, in charge of the affairs of the state. (A rumor at that time was that Wang Shenzhi's illness was due to poisoning by Wang Yanhan's wife Lady Cui.) Later in the year, Wang Shenzhi died, and Wang Yanhan took over the state, although at that time claiming only the title of acting military governor of Weiwu.\n\n== Personal information ==\n* Father** Wang Nin (王恁)* Mother** Lady Dong, posthumously honored Lady Dowager of Qin and yet later Lady Dowager Zhuanghui of Jin* Wife** Lady Ren Neiming, posthumously honored empress* Major Concubines** Lady Huang, the Lady of Lu, later honored empress dowager (honored 933), later grand empress dowager (honored 936), mother of Prince Yanjun** Lady Chen Jinfeng, later empress to Wang Yanjun* Children** Wang Yanhan (王延翰), later king** Wang Yanjun (王延鈞), name later changed to Wang Lin (王鏻), later Emperor Huizong** Wang Yanmei (王延美)** Wang Yanbao (王延保)** Wang Yanwu (王延武) (executed by Wang Jipeng 939)** Wang Yanwang (王延望) (executed by Wang Jipeng 939)** Wang Yanxī (王延羲, note different tone than his brother), name later changed to Wang Xi (王曦), later Emperor Jingzong** Wang Yanxǐ (王延喜, note different tone than his brother) (killed by Zhu Wenjin 944)** Wang Yanzheng (王延政), the Prince of Fusha, later emperor** Wang Yanzi (王延資)** Wang Yanzong (王延宗)** Lady of Langye, wife of Li Min (李敏)** Daughter, wife of Zhang Siqi (張思齊)** Lady of Langye, wife of Qian Yuanxiang (錢元珦), son of Qian Liu king of Wuyue** Daughter, wife of Yu Tingyin (余廷隱)** Daughter** Daughter** Daughter* Adoptive Children** Wang Yanbing (王延稟), né Zhou Yanchen (周彥琛) (executed by Wang Yanjun 931), posthumously honored Prince Lingzhao (honored 933?) then as Prince Weisu of Wuping (honored 943)** Wang Yanfeng (王延豐), biological child of Wang Shenzhi's brother Wang Chao\n\n==Notes and references==\n* History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 134.* New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 68.* Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 254, 259, 261, 262, 266, 267, 270, 271, 273, 274.* Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (十國春秋), [https://archive.org/stream/06075841.cn#page/n2/mode/2up vol. 90].\n\n{{s-start}}{{s-reg}}{{succession box| title=Prince of Min|before= None (Founder of kingdom)|years=909–925||after=Wang Yanhan}}{{s-end}}\n\n{{Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms rulers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wang, Shenzhi}}Category:862 birthsCategory:925 deathsCategory:Min (Ten Kingdoms) rulersCategory:Tang dynasty BuddhistsCategory:Min (Ten Kingdoms) BuddhistsCategory:Tang dynasty jiedushi of Weiwu CircuitCategory:Later Liang (Five Dynasties) jiedushi of Weiwu CircuitCategory:Later Liang (Five Dynasties) BuddhistsCategory:Later Tang jiedushi of Weiwu CircuitCategory:Politicians from XinyangCategory:Deified Chinese peopleCategory:Chinese princesCategory:Tang dynasty generals from HenanCategory:Min (Ten Kingdoms) people born during TangCategory:Tang dynasty politicians from Henan","tags":["deathdate","Liang","givenname"],"dateCreated":1496681089616,"dateModified":1496681089616},{"id":28147051,"title":"St Odoceus' Church, Llandawke","text":"{{Infobox church | name = St Odoceus' Church, Llandawke| fullname = | image = Llandawke Church - geograph.org.uk - 68422.jpg| imagesize = | imagealt = | caption = St Odoceus' Church, Llandawke, from the southwest | pushpin map = Wales Carmarthenshire| pushpin map alt = | pushpin mapsize = 250 | map caption = Location in Carmarthenshire | location = Llandawke, Carmarthenshire | country = Wales | coordinates = {{coord|51.7732|-4.4904|region:GB_type:landmark|display=title}} | osgraw = SN 282 112 | denomination = Church in Wales | churchmanship = | membership = | attendance = | website = [http://www.friendsoffriendlesschurches.org.uk/CMSMS/index.php?page=llandawke Friends of Friendless Churches] | former name = | bull date = | founded date = | founder = | dedication = St Odoceus | dedicated date = | consecrated date = | cult = | relics = | events = | past bishop = | people = | status = | functional status = Redundant| heritage designation = Grade II | designated date = 30 November 1966 | architect = | architectural type = Church | style = Gothic | groundbreaking = 13th century | completed date = | construction cost = | closed date = | demolished date = | capacity = | length = | width = | width nave = | height = | diameter = | other dimensions = | floor count = | floor area = | materials = Sandstone with slate roofs }}\n\nSt Odoceus' Church, Llandawke, is a redundant church situated in a hollow near the road between Llandawke and Laugharne in Carmarthenshire, Wales. It has been designated by Cadw as a Grade&nbsp;II listed building, and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches.\n\n==History==\n\nThe church dates from the 13th&nbsp;century and it was remodelled during the following century by Sir&nbsp;Guy De&nbsp;Brian, the Lord Marcher of Laugharne. The church was restored during the Victorian era. When it was inspected by Cadw in 1988 it was described as being \"partly overgrown\". It was taken under the care of the charity, the Friends of Friendless Churches in 2006, when it was in \"a state of dereliction\". The charity holds a 999-year lease with effect from 24&nbsp;April 2006. A local group of Friends has been formed to assist in its repair and restoration.\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Exterior===\nIt is constructed in local sandstone with slate roofs in Gothic style. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave without aisles, a three-bay chancel that is lower and narrower, and a west tower. The tower is squat, in two stages, and it tapers as it rises. In the upper stage, on the west and south sides are lancet bell openings. Its roof is pyramidal, and on its north side is a stair turret. On the apex of the gable at the east end of the nave is a crucifix finial. The entrance is on the south side of the church through an arched doorway. To the left of the entrance is a two-light, square-headed Perpendicular window and to its right is a two-light Decorated window with Victorian tracery. The windows in the chancel also have two lights, those on the north wall being square-headed, and those on the east and south walls having pointed heads.\n\n===Interior===\nOn the south side of the chancel is a piscina and a recess that formerly contained a tomb. On the north side is a 14th-century effigy of a figure thought to be that of Margaret Marlos. It is broken into three pieces, which is said to be a reference to her being cut into three pieces by robbers. It was placed in the church in 1902. Also in the church is an early Christian stone slab dating from the 5th or 6th&nbsp;century. It is carved with Ogham and Roman inscriptions. The oak altar dating from 1882 is \"elaborately not to say wildly carved\" with representations of flowers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Odoceus Church, Llandawke}}Category:13th-century churchesLlandawke, Saint OdoceusLlandawkeCategory:English Gothic architecture in CarmarthenshireCategory:Churches preserved by the Friends of Friendless Churches","tags":["century","coordinates","Odoceus"],"dateCreated":1496681064903,"dateModified":1496681064903},{"id":28557393,"title":"Bhopatpur","text":"{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}{{Use Indian English|date=December 2013}}{{Orphan|date=August 2010}}Bhopatpur is a village in Kaushambi district, Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord|24|53|N|80|06|E|display=title|region:IN_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\nCategory:Villages in Kaushambi district\n\n{{Kaushambi-geo-stub}}","tags":["a","a","village"],"dateCreated":1496681089638,"dateModified":1496681089638},{"id":28859858,"title":"Pärsama","text":"{{unreferenced|date=July 2012}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement|official_name =Pärsama|native_name = |settlement_type =Village|motto =|image_skyline = |imagesize = |image_caption = |image_flag = |flag_size =|image_seal = |seal_size =|image_map = |map_caption = |pushpin_map =|mapsize =|coordinates_display = inline,title|coordinates_region = EE|subdivision_type = Country|subdivision_name = {{flag|Estonia}}|subdivision_type1 = County|subdivision_name1 = Saare County|subdivision_type2 = Parish|subdivision_name2 = Leisi Parish{{cn|date=October 2016}}|leader_title = |leader_name = |established_title =|established_date = |area_total_km2 = |area_footnotes = |population_as_of = |population_total =|population_density_km2 =|timezone =EET|utc_offset = +2|timezone_DST = EEST|utc_offset_DST = +3|latd=|latm=|lats= |latNS=N|longd=|longm= |longs=|longEW=E|area_code = |website = }}Pärsama is a village in Leisi Parish, Saare County in western Estonia.{{cn|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{Leisi Parish}}\n\n{{coord|58|30|N|22|45|E|display=title|region:EE_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parsama}}Category:Villages in Saare County\n\n{{Saare-geo-stub}}","tags":["Parishsubdivisionname","imagecaption","imagesize"],"dateCreated":1496681064944,"dateModified":1496681064944},{"id":2934536,"title":"Emphyteusis","text":"{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}An emphyteusis is a real right (right in rem), susceptible of assignment and of descent, charged on productive real estate, the right being coupled with the enjoyment of the property on condition of taking care of the estate and paying taxes, and sometimes the payment of a small rent.\n\nAkin to a system of serfdom, this practice emerged in some South American colonies during the time of colonization. Based on Roman law, the Spanish preserved it and brought it to the colonies. Of Roman origin, the practice of emphyteusis appeared in the early empire and was initially granted by the state for agricultural purposes, or for building on land.\n\nSuch a lease involves the disbursement of a usufruct, and abusus to an emphyteutic lessee, and typically includes:* An immovable;* Right to make full use of immovable;* A term stipulated in the agreement; and* Obligation to make improvements that durably increase the value of the land, which will belong to land owner at the end of emphyteusis.\n\nEmphyteusis is typically created for a term of 10 – 100 years.

The company was incorporated in California in January 1994 and was reincorporated in Delaware in 2007. In January 2010 the company was incorporated again in Delaware as Corsair Components, Inc. Corsair designs and sells a range of products for computers, including high-speed DRAM modules, ATX power supplies (PSUs), USB flash drives (UFDs), memory and case cooling solutions, gaming peripherals, computer cases, solid-state drive<nowiki/>s (SSDs), and speakers.\n\nIn addition to its worldwide headquarters in Fremont, California, Corsair maintains a production facility in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, for assembly, test, and packaging of select products, distribution centers in Asia, the United States, and Europe, and has sales and marketing offices throughout the United States of America as well as several European and Asian countries.\n\n==History==\nThe company was founded as Corsair Microsystems in 1994 by Andy Paul, Don Lieberman, and John Beekley. Corsair originally developed Level 2 cache modules, called Cache on a stick or COAST modules, for OEMs. After Intel incorporated the L2 cache in the processor with the release of its Pentium Pro processor family, Corsair changed its focus to DRAM modules, primarily in the server market. In 2002, Corsair began shipping DRAM modules that were designed to appeal to computer enthusiasts, who were using them for overclocking. Since then, Corsair has continued to produce memory modules for PCs, and has added other PC components as well.\n\nCorsair expanded its DRAM memory module production into the high end market for overclocking. This expansion allows for high power platforms and the ability to get more performance out of the CPU and RAM. The Corsair Vengeance Pro series and Corsair Dominator Platinum series are built for overclocking applications.\n\nCorsair has since expanded their product line to include many types of high-end gaming peripherals, high performance air and water cooling solutions, and other enthusiast-grade components. \n\n==Products==\nThe company's products include:\n\n*DRAM and DIMM memory modules for desktop and laptop PCs*USB flash drives*ATX and SFX PSUs\n\n*Computer cases*Pre-built high end gaming PCs*Liquid CPU and GPU cooling solutions*Computer fans*Solid-state drives*Audio headsets for gaming*Keyboards*Mice*Mouse Pads\n\n==See also==\n*List of computer hardware manufacturers{{Portal|Companies}}{{commons category|Corsair Memory}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.corsair.com/}}*[http://www.secdatabase.com/CIK/1486183/Company-Name/CORSAIR-COMPONENTS-INC.

On 7 January 1862, approximately 3,000 French soldiers landed at Vera Cruz. Small British and Spanish contingents that were originally part of the adventure preferred to withdraw quickly leaving only the French forces assisted by small numbers of Austrian, Belgian and Turkish troops.\n\nThese forces, whose numbers would later rise to approximately 38,000 men, were successively placed under the command of generals Charles de Lorencez, Élie Frédéric Forey and finally François Achille Bazaine. The campaign was the scene of some of the most notable battles in French military history, such as the glorious struggle for the village of Camaron where, on 30 April 1863, sixty two legionnaires resisted bravely for nine hours against over two thousand Mexicans, allowing for the capture of the city of Puebla on 17 May 1863 thus paving the way to Mexico. In the capital, an assembly of notables recognized Archduke Maximilian of Habsburg, brother of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.\n\nHowever, even with the support of 20,000 Mexicans who embraced the new emperor, Maximilian's forces were harassed in their work of pacification by the troops of President Benito Juárez who had the support of the United States. In February 1867, Emperor Napoleon III ordered the repatriation of all remaining French troops from Mexico, the last elements left the port of Vera Cruz on 12 March 1867. An abandoned Emperor Maximilian, defeated and captured near the city of Querétaro, was executed in June of that year.\n\n==Award statute==\nThe Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition was awarded by the emperor, to all those who took part in the Mexico Expedition, upon nomination and approval by the minister under which the corps or service of the potential recipient was attached. The medal was to be worn on the left breast.\n\nNo minimum time of service was mentioned in the award statute.\n\nA later decree of 16 April 1864 added the Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition to the list of previous awards that could be revoked following a condemnation to a fixed prison term of one year or more for a crime committed by the recipient.\n\n==Award description==\nThe Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition was a 30 mm in diameter circular silver medal. Its obverse bore the left profile of Emperor Napoleon III crowned with a laurel wreath surrounded by the relief inscription \"NAPOLEON III\" \"EMPEREUR\" ({{lang-en|\"NAPOLEON III EMPEROR\"}}). A 4 mm wide relief laurel wreath ran along the entire circumference of both the obverse and reverse of the medal.\n\nOn the reverse, within the laurel wreath, the circular relief inscription \" * EXPEDITION DU MEXIQUE * 1862•1863\" ({{lang-en|\"MEXICAN EXPEDITION 1862•1863\"}}), two small five pointed stars separating the text from the dates. At the center, the relief inscription on five lines of the campaign's major battles \"CUMBRES\" \"CERRO-BORREGO\" \"SAN-LORENZO\" \"PUEBLA\" \"MEXICO\".\n\nThe medal hung from a 36 mm wide white silk moiré ribbon bearing 5 mm red and green stripes arranged at a 45 degree angle forming a cross, over which was superimposed a black eagle, its wings spread and holding a green snake in its beak and talons, a design inspired by the coat of arms of Mexico.\n\n<gallery>Image:Expedition du Mexique 1863 revers.jpg|Reverse of the Commemorative medal of the Mexico ExpeditionImage:Médaille Mexique 02.jpg|Award certificate.Image:Coat of arms of Mexico (1823-1864, 1867-1893).svg|Coat of arms of MexicoFile:Emperador Maximiliano I de Mexico.jpg|Emperor MaximilianFile:Adolphe Yvon - Portrait of Napoleon III - Walters 3795.jpg|Emperor Napoléon III</gallery>\n\n==Notable recipients (partial list)==\n*Marshal of France Élie Frédéric Forey*General Pierre Émile Arnaud Édouard de Colbert-Chabannais*General Gustave Léon Niox*General Jean François Jules Herbé*General Armand Alexandre de Castagny*General Philippe Marie André Roussel de Courcy*General Auguste Mercier*General Édouard Aymard*Admiral Henri Rieunier*Rear admiral Benjamin Jaurès*Colonel Charles Nicolas Friant*Colonel Charles Paul Narcisse Moreau*Navy captain Henri Rivière*Major Napoléon Charles Bonaparte, 5th Prince of Canino*Ottoman general Vitalis Pacha\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War|Colonialism|Military history of France}}*1st Foreign Regiment*Battle of Camarón*List of battles of the French intervention in Mexico*History of Mexico*Pastry War*Reform War\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.musee-legiondhonneur.fr/00_koama/visu_lh/index.asp?sid=320 Museum of the Legion of Honour] (in French)\n\n{{French medals}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Commemorative medal of the Mexico Expedition}}Category:Military awards and decorations of FranceCategory:Awards established in 1863Category:1863 establishments in FranceCategory:French campaign medals","tags":["Commemorative","the","Expedition"],"dateCreated":1496681064959,"dateModified":1496681064959},{"id":31746161,"title":"Suroor Barabankvi","text":"Suroor Barabankvi (1919&ndash;1980) (Urdu: سرور بارہ بنکوی ) was an Urdu poet and lyricist from Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, India.

The Executive Council proceeded to the election of one member of the African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL) and five Members of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR). During the discussions, Ministers considered reports issued by the following African Union entities:\n\n* The African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACERWC)* The Pan-African Parliament (PAP)* African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR)* The African Union Advisory Board on Corruption* The African Union Commission on International Law (AUCIL)* The General Assembly of ECOSOCC\n\n===Heads of State===\nHeads of States convened from 30 June - 1 July 2011 in Malabo to adopt decisions and recommendations of the 19th Ordinary Session of the Executive Council as well as the declarations of the summit.

Prior to the meeting, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told Bloomberg's Franz Wild of his intention to discuss with the AU delegation from Algeria a timeline for constructing a trans-Sahara pipeline to take natural gas to Europe. Among the decisions reached by African Union leaders was to propose ceasefire talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia between the Libyan government and Libyan rebels. The proposal for Libya called for international peace keepers to monitor the cease-fire and asked the United Nations Security Council to lift a freeze on Libyan assets.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhefW9tl8U0 AFP Video: African Union summit dogged by Libya]\n\nCategory:African UnionCategory:2011 in Equatorial GuineaCategory:Diplomatic conferences in Equatorial GuineaCategory:2011 in international relationsCategory:21st-century diplomatic conferencesCategory:2011 conferencesCategory:21st century in Malabo","tags":["his","addition","Nguema"],"dateCreated":1496681089558,"dateModified":1496681089558},{"id":32243600,"title":"Robert Schwartz","text":"Robert Schwartz may refer to:\n\n* Robert Schwartz, American designer of the M65 Atomic Cannon* Robert A.

The race took place from 19–23 November, and was run from Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, to Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, over 8 stages and {{convert|3077|km|mi}}. 182 cars started the race, and 60 finished all 8 stages.\n\n==Pre-race==\nFor the 1953 race, the existing Sports and Stock classes were both subdivided into Large and Small groups, giving four categories in which to compete. These were split by engine capacity; sports cars were divided under and over 1600 cc (98 ci), and stock cars under and over 3500 cc (213.5 ci). This was to accommodate the huge number of participants and the diverse breeds of cars within the race.\n\nGoing into the race, Ferrari had a slender championship lead of just two points over Jaguar. Although neither manufacturer had sent work entries to Mexico, the title could still be snatched by the Coventry marque, despite the Italian marque having more cars in the event.\n\n==Race==\nBoth Lancia and Lincoln came to the race highly organized and both factories swept 1–2–3 finishes in their respective categories. The Europeans dominated the sports categories, and the Americans the stock. Large Sports Cars was won by Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina and Gino Bronzoni of Italy in a Lancia D24 Pininfarina, Small Sports Cars by José Herrarte Ariano and Carlos González from Guatemala in a Porsche 550 Coupé. Large Stock Cars was won by Chuck Stevenson and Clay Smith of the United States in a Lincoln Capri and Small Stock Cars by C.D. Evans and Walter Krause, Jr., also of the U.S., in a six-cylinder Chevrolet 210. Stevenson has the distinction of being the only person to ever win twice in the original race.\n\nThe race was marred by the death of a number of competitors. The co-driver and pacenote systems championed by the Mercedes-Benz teams of the previous year were vindicated by the failure of an alternative system used by some other works drivers, notably those of Lancia. During pre-race runs of the route at much safer speeds, Felice Bonetto and Piero Taruffi, winner of the 1951 edition of the race, painted warning signals on the road to remind themselves of particular hazards. This resulted in the death of Bonetto who, leading the race under pressure from Taruffi, missed his own warning signs. Entering the village of Silao, he encountered rough pavement at excessive speed and impacted a building, killing him instantly.\n\nAs a result of Guido Mancini and Fabrizio Serena di Lapigio finishing in fourth place, in their Ferrari 375 MM Pininfarina Berlinetta, they secured three points for Ferrari, thereby increasing the Maranello marque points lead over Jaguar, giving them the 1953 World Championship for Manufacturer title.\n\nThe race was held over eight stages over a total distance of 1,912 miles. Fangio and Bronzoni won in their works-entered Lancia D24 Pininfarina. The pair finished the race in 18 hours and 11 minutes, averaging {{convert|169.221|km/h|mi/h}}. Second place went to their team-mates, Piero Taruffi and Luigi Maggio, in their D24, just 7:51 minutes behind. The podium was complete by another of the Scuderia Lancia cars that of Eugenio Castellotti, with his co-driver, Carlo Luoni, in their Lancia D23, over 6:01 minutes adrift.\n\n==Official Classification==\n\nClass Winners are in Bold text.\n\n} Billey Saidel || Ford V-8 || 1 || DNF|-! 127<br />DNF| TS || 205 || Jose Antonio Marin || {{flagicon|MEX|1934}} Jose Antonio Marin<br />{{flagicon|MEX|1934}} Miguel Lecuona || Plymouth Belvedere || 1 || DNF|-! 128<br />DNF| TS || 208 || A.

The work was written in 1237, ten years after Dōgen's return from his time in Song Dynasty China. At this time he was practicing at the monastery he had founded four years earlier, Kōshō-ji. During this period he wrote several of his best known works such as Bendōwa, Fukan Zazengi, and Genjōkōan. However, the language and style in the Instructions are regarded as more concrete and straightforward than these other popular works. Instructions for the Cook is included as the first part of the Eihei Shingi, or Rules of Purity for Eihei-ji.\n\nRenpō Niwa, a former abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first part is the preface in which Dōgen emphasizes the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (Sanshin, 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.\n\n==Allusions to Kōan==\nDōgen's essay makes numerous allusions to other works, especially kōans. One such reference is to a kōan attributed to Dongshan Shouchu that appears in both the Gateless Gate and the Blue Cliff Record. In it, Dongshan is asked, \"What is Buddha\"?, to which he replies, \"Three pounds of hemp\". Dōgen mentions the kōan in the opening of the essay while arguing how serious a position tenzo is, stating that Dongshan had this insight during his time serving as tenzo. While hemp may seem unrelated to the kitchen, the Zen scholars Shohaku Okumura and Taigen Dan Leighton suggest 'hemp' (麻) may be a mistranslation and that 'sesame' (胡麻) was intended, which makes more sense in the context of cooking. Dōgen mentions the kōan in order to suggest that the most simple activities, such as working with everyday ingredients, are no different from awakening when approached directly and with a clear mind.\n\nAnother kōan quoted in the work involves an encounter with the abbot Dongshan Liangjie and a tenzo at his monastery named Xuefeng Yicun. In the story, which is taken from the Zen en Shingi (Pure Standards of the Zen Garden, 禅苑清規), Xuefeng is cleaning rice when Dongshan asks, \"Are you sifting the sand and removing the rice, or sifting the rice and removing the sand\"? Xuefeng responds that both are removed at the same time. Dongshan then says, \"What will the great assembly eat?\" In response to this, Xuefeng overturns the bowl. Dongshan says, \"In the future you will go and be scrutinized by someone else\". The final line references the fact that Xuefeng ultimately studied under Touzi Datong, Dongshan, and Deshan Xuanjian before finally receiving dharma transmission. According to Kōryō Shinno in an essay on the kōans of Tenzo Kyōkun, Xuefeng gives his answer in order to express the nondualism of his activity. However, Dongshan follows up by reminding him that while his answer demonstrates a grasp on the absolute meaning of his activity, he is forgetting the utility value (i.e. feeding the other practitioners) and thus his apparently absolute understanding is in fact limited. Xuefeng does not grasp this and turns over the rice washing bowl in frustration.\n\n==Translations==\nThe short text that comprises the Instructions for the Cook has been translated into English and other languages, often as a part of the Eihei Shingi, or Rules of Purity for Eiheiji.

She unconvincingly pretends that there is too much interference to understand him.Sisko decides to allow her to look for Worf and to send her the Defiant's search log. Dax has the computer extrapolate a likely entry point for Worf's escape pod into the Badlands, then she takes the runabout in and cuts the engine, hoping that the currents will take her to Worf's position.\n\nOn the station, Sisko and Kasidy Yates discuss the plans for Sisko's house on Bajor.Sisko says he wants the house to be 'our house'.

He questions Ezri's motives for rescuing him and resents her speaking as if she was Jadzia Dax. Their runabout is gunned down by the Jem'Hadar, and Dax and Worf hastily transport to a nearby planet without a comm unit.\n\nOn Cardassia,Damar, who's becoming more of an alcoholic, is visited by Dukat, who asks for a recommendation for a doctor to surgically alter him to make him look Bajoran.\n\nOn the planet where they landed, Dax and Worf argue.After the argument intensifies, they kiss then have sex.Then they are captured by the Breen.\n\nOn Cardassia,Dukat's surgery to appear Bajoran is revealed to be complete.\n\nOn the Station,the Prophets appear as Sarah Sisko in a vision to Ben and tell him that marrying Kasidy will bring him great sorrow.\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb episode|0708579}}* {{TV.com episode|star-trek-deep-space-nine/penumbra-1-21011}}{{Memory Alpha|Penumbra}}{{StarTrek.com link|DS9|105485}}\n\n{{Star Trek Cardassian stories}}{{Star Trek DS9 S7}}{{Star Trek DS9}}{{Star Trek}}\n\nCategory:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodesCategory:1999 American television episodes","tags":["prev","next","episode"],"dateCreated":1496680662182,"dateModified":1496680662182},{"id":38692360,"title":"Shah Rukan e Alam","text":"{{Multiple issues|{{unreferenced|date=June 2013}}{{lead too short|date=June 2013}}{{notability|Geography|date=June 2013}}}}{{Infobox settlement| name = Shah Rukan e Alam| native_name = | native_name_lang = | settlement_type = Neighbourhood| image_skyline = | image_caption = | image_flag = | image_seal = | image_shield = | image_map = | map_caption = | pushpin_map = Pakistan| pushpin_map_alt = Location of Shah Rukan e Alam as shown within the map of Pakistan| pushpin_map_caption = Location in Pakistan| coordinates = {{coord|30.164627|71.441451|region:PK|display=inline,title}}| subdivision_type = Country| subdivision_name = Pakistan| subdivision_type1 = Province| subdivision_name1 = Punjab| subdivision_type2 = District| subdivision_name2 = Multan| established_title = | established_date = | leader_party = | leader_title = | leader_name = | unit_pref = Metric| area_total_km2 = | area_land_km2 = | area_water_km2 = | elevation_footnotes = | elevation_m = | population_footnotes = | population_total = | population_as_of = | population_density_km2 = auto| timezone1 = PST| utc_offset1 = +5| timezone1_DST = | utc_offset1_DST = | postal_code_type = | postal_code = | area_code_type = | area_code = | website = }}Shah Rukan e Alam is one of the autonomous towns of the city of Multan in the Punjab province of Pakistan.\n\n{{Neighbourhoods of Multan}}\n\nCategory:Populated places in Multan District\n\n{{Pakistan-geo-stub}}","tags":["the","leadername","autonomous"],"dateCreated":1496681089576,"dateModified":1496681089576},{"id":38849219,"title":"Lifepod (1981 film)","text":"{{Multiple issues|{{unreferenced|date=March 2013}}{{notability|Films|date=March 2013}}{{all plot|date=March 2013}}}}{{italic title}}\n\n{{Infobox film| name = Lifepod| image = | caption = | director = Bruce Bryant| producer = James Castle| writer = Bruce Bryant (screenplay), Carol Johnsen (screenplay)| based on = | starring = | music = | cinematography = | editing = Don Zirpola| studio = | distributor = Golden Key Entertainment| released = {{Film date|1981}}| runtime = 90min| language = English| country = United States| budget = | gross = }}Lifepod is a 1981 science fiction film distributed by Golden Key Entertainment. It stars Joe Penny, Jordan Michals, Kristine DeBell, Carl Lumbly and Sandy Kenyon.\n\n==Plot outline==\nThe film takes place in 2191. The latest space liner for the Whitestar Lines is the Arcturus, currently on its maiden voyage. On its approach to Callisto, for unknown reasons, the ship's computer, the Main Cerebral, declares a red five emergency, and orders \"abandon ship\". Most of the crew and passengers leave in lifepods. Captain Montaine (Christopher Cary) stays on the bridge. Cerebral begins to evacuate the ship's compartments of oxygen. Third astrogator G.W. Simmons is caught on deck 16 while it still retains an atmosphere. He runs into Fiona Harrison (Kristine DeBell) a passenger from deck 15 who did not leave with the others because she had to go back for her bird, Dwayne. Because life support has been shut down for all the decks below, Simmons and Fiona head to the bridge via an elevator. When the doors open on deck one they are met by news reporter Roz Keshah (Carl Lumbly) from level 3, he is wearing a tiny and discrete, optical head-mounted display/camera predictive of Google Glass. He has found two people, Whitestar Lines director and major stockholder Lloyd DeMatte and his companion the Lady Lima.\n\nOn the biobridge the five meet Captain Montaine, who is accosted by DeMatte and accused of damaging the Arcturus. The captain explains the situation, then offers an escape tunnel to a lifepod. He remains behind, out of duty as the captain and also a strong sense of curiosity. Fiona accidentally leaves Dwayne behind, who becomes a sort of companion for the captain.\n\nSimmons takes command of lifepod#3; DeMatte attempts to hijack it and is killed in the process.

The artist Roy Ascott elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in \"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in \"The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose\" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian Edward A. Shanken has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including \"[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]\" and \"From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott\"(2003), which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to telematic art (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to net.art.)\n\nAudio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. Steina and Woody Vasulka, for example, used \"all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media.\"\n\nWith related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, Wen-Ying Tsai and cybernetician Gordon Pask and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and Jean Tinguely, the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and Gene Youngblood drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist Roy Ascott with his essay \"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and the American critic and theorist Jack Burnham. In \"Beyond Modern Sculpture\" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.\n\nLeading art theorists and historians in this field include Christiane Paul, Frank Popper, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Dominique Moulon, Robert C. Morgan, Roy Ascott, Margot Lovejoy, Edmond Couchot, Fred Forest and Edward A. Shanken.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin|width=80%}}{{col-5}}* Cyborg art* Computer art* Conceptual art* Cyberarts* Cybism* Electronic art\n\n{{col-5}}* Generative art* Internet art* Neo-conceptual art* New media art* Post-conceptual art\n\n{{col-5}}* Post-convergent* Postminimalism* Postmodern art* Systems art* Virtual art\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web | url = http://iasl.uni-muenchen.de/links/GCA-II.3e.html | title = Thomas Dreher: History of Computer Art, chap.

It is known for its political repression and conduction of the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin. \n\nThe agency was led by Genrikh Yagoda (executed in 1938), Nikolai Yezhov (executed in 1940) and Lavrentiy Beria (executed in 1953). The NKVD was formed from Felix Dzerzhinsky's Cheka, and became known as the NKVD title under Stalin. When Nikita Khrushchev took power, the agency was renamed as the KGB. Under Vladimir Putin, they were known as the FSB.\n\nThe NKVD conducted mass extrajudicial executions, conceived, populated and administered the Gulag system of forced labor camps, were responsible for the repression of the Kulaks, and the mass deportations of entire nationalities to unpopulated regions of the country. They were responsible for the protection of Soviet borders and espionage (which included political assassinations), as well as enforcing Stalinist policy in communist movements and puppet governments in other countries, mostly notably in the terror operations conducted in Poland.\n\n== History and structure ==\n{{main|Cheka|Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies}}After the Russian February Revolution of 1917, the Provisional Government dissolved the Tsar's police and created the People's Militsiya. The subsequent Russian October Revolution of 1917, was a seizure of state power led by Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who established a new Bolshevik regime, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) turned into NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs) under a People's Commissar. However, the NKVD apparatus was overwhelmed by duties inherited from MVD, such as the supervision of the local governments and firefighting, and the Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya staffed by proletarians was largely inexperienced and unqualified. Realizing that it was left with no capable security force, the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR created a secret political police, the Cheka, led by Felix Dzerzhinsky. It gained the right to undertake quick non-judicial trials and executions, if that was deemed necessary in order to \"protect the Russian Socialist-Communist revolution\".\n\nThe Cheka was reorganized in 1922 as the State Political Directorate, or GPU, of the NKVD of the RSFSR. In 1922, the USSR was formed with the RSFSR as its largest member. The GPU became the OGPU (Joint State Political Directorate), under the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR. The NKVD of the RSFSR retained control of the militsiya, and various other responsibilities.\n\nIn 1934, the NKVD of the RSFSR was transformed into an all-union security force, the NKVD (which the Communist Party of the Soviet Union leaders soon came to call \"the leading detachment of our party\"), and the OGPU was incorporated into the NKVD as the Main Directorate for State Security (GUGB); the separate NKVD of the RSFSR was not resurrected until 1946 (as the MVD of the RSFSR). As a result, the NKVD also became responsible for all detention facilities (including the forced labor camps, known as the GULag) as well as for the regular police. Until the reorganization begun by Nikolai Yezhov with a purge of the regional political police in the autumn of 1936 and formalized by a May 1939 directive of the All-Union NKVD by which all appointments to the local political police were controlled from the center, there was frequent tension between centralized control of local units and the collusion of those units with local and regional party elements, frequently resulting in the thwarting of Moscow's plans.\n\nSince its creation in 1934, the NKVD underwent many organizational changes; between 1938 and 1939 alone, the NKVD's structure and leadership changed three times.\n\nOn February 3, 1941, the Special Sections of the NKVD responsible for military counterintelligence (CI) became part of the Army and Navy (RKKA and RKKF, respectively). The GUGB was separated from the NKVD and renamed the People's Commissariat for State Security (NKGB). After the German invasion, the NKVD and NKGB were reunited on July 20, 1941. The CI sections were returned to the NKVD in January 1942. In April 1943, the CI sections were again transferred to the People's Commissariats (Narkomat) of Defense and the Navy, becoming SMERSH (from Smert' Shpionam or \"Death to Spies\"); at the same time, the NKVD was again separated from the NKGB.\n\nIn 1946, all Soviet Commissariats were renamed \"ministries\". Accordingly, the NKVD of the USSR was renamed as the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), while the NKGB was renamed as the Ministry of State Security (MGB). In 1953, after the arrest of Lavrenty Beria, the MGB was merged back into the MVD. The police and security services were finally split in 1954 to become:\n\n* The USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), responsible for the criminal militia and correctional facilities.* The USSR Committee for State Security (KGB), responsible for the political police, intelligence, counter-intelligence, personal protection (of the leadership) and confidential communications.\n\n===Main Directorates (Departments)===\n* State Security* Workers-Peasants Militsiya* Border and Internal Security* Fire Security* Correction and Labor camps* Other smaller departments** Department of Civil registration** Financial (FINO)** Administration** Human resources** Secretariat** Special assignment\n\n===Ranking system (State Security)===\nIn 1935-1945 Main Directorate of State Security of NKVD had its own ranking system before it was merged in the Soviet military standardized ranking system.;Top-level commanding staff* Commissar General of State Security (later in 1935)* Commissar of State Security 1st Class* Commissar of State Security 2nd Class* Commissar of State Security 3rd Class* Commissar of State Security (Senior Major of State Security, before 1943);Senior commanding staff* Colonel of State Security (Major of State Security, before 1943)* Lieutenant Colonel of State Security (Captain of State Security, before 1943)* Major of State Security (Senior Lieutenant of State Security, before 1943);Mid-level commanding staff* Captain of State Security (Lieutenant of State Security, before 1943)* Senior Lieutenant of State Security (Junior Lieutenant of State Security, before 1943)* Lieutenant of State Security (Sergeant of State Security, before 1942)* Junior Lieutenant of State Security (Sergeant of State Security, before 1942);Junior commanding staff* Sergeant Major of Special Service* Senior Sergeant of Special Service* Sergeant of Special Service* Junior Sergeant of Special Service\n\n== NKVD activities ==\nThe main function of the NKVD was to protect the state security of the Soviet Union. This role was accomplished through massive political repression, including authorised murders of many thousands of politicians and citizens, as well as kidnappings, assassinations and mass deportations.\n\n===Domestic repressions and executions===\nthumb{{for|detailed articles on the issue|:Category:Political repression in the Soviet Union{{!}}Category:Political repression in the Soviet Union}}\n\nIn implementing Soviet internal policy towards perceived enemies of the Soviet state (\"enemies of the people\"), untold multitudes of people were sent to GULAG camps and hundreds of thousands were executed by the NKVD. Formally, most of these people were convicted by NKVD troikas (\"triplets\")– special courts martial. Evidential standards were very low: a tip-off by an anonymous informer was considered sufficient grounds for arrest. Use of \"physical means of persuasion\" (torture) was sanctioned by a special decree of the state, which opened the door to numerous abuses, documented in recollections of victims and members of the NKVD itself. Hundreds of mass graves resulting from such operations were later discovered throughout the country. Documented evidence exists that the NKVD committed mass extrajudicial executions, guided by secret \"plans\". Those plans established the number and proportion of victims (officially \"public enemies\") in a given region (e.g. the quotas for clergy, former nobles etc., regardless of identity). The families of the repressed, including children, were also automatically repressed according to NKVD Order no. 00486.\n\nThe purges were organized in a number of waves according to the decisions of the Politburo of the Communist Party. Some examples are the campaigns among engineers (Shakhty Trial), party and military elite plots (Great Purge with Order 00447), and medical staff (\"Doctors' Plot\").\n\nA number of mass operations of the NKVD were related to the prosecution of whole ethnic categories. For example, the Polish Operation of the NKVD in 1937–1938 resulted in the execution of 111,091 Poles. Whole populations of certain ethnicities were forcibly resettled. Foreigners living in the Soviet Union were given particular attention. When disillusioned American citizens living in the Soviet Union thronged the gates of the U.S. embassy in Moscow to plead for new U.S. passports to leave USSR (their original U.S. passports had been taken for 'registration' purposes years before), none were issued. Instead, the NKVD promptly arrested all of the Americans, who were taken to Lubyanka Prison and later shot. American factory workers at the Soviet Ford GAZ plant, suspected by Stalin of being 'poisoned' by Western influences, were dragged off with the others to Lubyanka by the NKVD in the very same Ford Model A cars they had helped build, where they were tortured; nearly all were executed or died in labor camps. Many of the slain Americans were dumped in the mass grave at Yuzhnoye Butovo District near Moscow. Even so, the people of the Soviet Republics still formed the majority of NKVD victims[*17][*18].\n\nThe NKVD also served as arm of the Russian Soviet communist government for the lethal mass persecution and destruction of ethnic minorities and religious beliefs, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Greek Catholics, Islam, Judaism and other religious organizations, an operation headed by Yevgeny Tuchkov.\n\n===International operations, kidnappings, and assassinations===\nDuring the 1930s, the NKVD was responsible for political murders of those Stalin believed to oppose him. Espionage networks headed by experienced multilingual NKVD officers such as Pavel Sudoplatov and Iskhak Akhmerov were established in nearly every major Western country, including the United States. The NKVD recruited agents for its espionage efforts from all walks of life, from unemployed intellectuals such as Mark Zborowski to aristocrats such as Martha Dodd. Besides the gathering of intelligence, these networks provided organizational assistance for so-called wet business, where enemies of the USSR either disappeared or were openly liquidated.\n\nThe NKVD's intelligence and special operations (Inostranny Otdel) unit organized overseas assassinations of political enemies of the USSR, such as leaders of nationalist movements, former Tsarist officials, and personal rivals of Joseph Stalin. Among the officially confirmed victims of such plots were:\n\n* Leon Trotsky, a personal political enemy of Stalin and his most bitter international critic, killed in Mexico City in 1940;* Yevhen Konovalets, prominent Ukrainian patriot leader who was attempting to create a separatist movement in Soviet Ukraine; assassinated in Rotterdam, Netherlands*Yevgeny Miller, former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army; in the 1930s, he was responsible for funding anti-communist movements inside the USSR with the support of European governments. Kidnapped in Paris and brought to Moscow, where he was interrogated and executed* Noe Ramishvili, Prime Minister of independent Georgia, fled to France after the Bolshevik takeover; responsible for funding and coordinating Georgian nationalist organizations and the August uprising, he was assassinated in Paris* Boris Savinkov, Russian revolutionary and anti-Bolshevik terrorist (lured back into Russia and killed in 1924 by the Trust Operation of the GPU);* Sidney Reilly, British agent of the MI6 who deliberately entered Russia in 1925 trying to expose the Trust Operation to avenge Savinkov's death;* Alexander Kutepov, former General of the Tsarist (Imperial Russian) Army, who was active in organizing anti-communist groups with the support of French and British governments\n\nProminent political dissidents were also killed found dead under highly suspicious circumstances, including Walter Krivitsky, Lev Sedov, Ignace Reiss and former German Communist Party (KPD) member Willi Münzenberg.\n\nThe pro-Soviet leader Sheng Shicai in Xinjiang received NKVD assistance in conducting a purge to coincide with Stalin's Great Purge in 1937. Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a \"Fascist Trotskyite plot\" to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General Ma Hushan, Ma Shaowu, Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and Hoja-Niyaz were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control. Stalin opposed the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, NKVD agents, acting in conjunction with the Communist Party of Spain, exercised substantial control over the Republican government, using Soviet military aid to help further Soviet influence. The NKVD established numerous secret prisons around the capital Madrid, which were used to detain, torture, and kill hundreds of the NKVD's enemies, at first focusing on Spanish Nationalists and Spanish Catholics, while from late 1938 increasingly anarchists and Trotskyists were the objects of persecution. In 1937 Andrés Nin, the secretary of the Trotskyist POUM and his colleagues were tortured and killed in an NKVD prison in Barcelona.\n\n===World War II operations===\n\nPrior to the German invasion, in order to accomplish its own goals, the NKVD was prepared to cooperate even with such organizations as the German Gestapo. In March 1940 representatives of the NKVD and the Gestapo met for one week in Zakopane, to coordinate the pacification of Poland; see Gestapo–NKVD Conferences. For its part, the Soviet Union delivered hundreds of German and Austrian Communists to the Gestapo, as unwanted foreigners, together with their documents. However, many NKVD units were later to fight the Wehrmacht, for example the 10th Rifle Division NKVD, which fought at the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nAfter the German invasion the NKVD evacuated and killed prisoners.\n\nDuring World War II, NKVD Internal Troops units were used for rear area security, including preventing the retreat of Soviet Union army divisions. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used at the front to stem the occurrence of desertion through Stalin's Order No. 270 and Order No. 227 decrees in 1941 and 1942, which aimed to raise troop morale via brutality and coercion. At the beginning of the war the NKVD formed 15 rifle divisions, which had expanded by 1945 to 53 divisions and 28 brigades. A list of identified NKVD Internal Troops divisions can be seen at List of Soviet Union divisions. Though mainly intended for internal security, NKVD divisions were sometimes used in the front-lines, for example during the Battle of Stalingrad and the Crimean Offensive of 1944. Unlike the Waffen-SS, the NKVD did not field any armored or mechanized units..\n\nIn the enemy-held territories, the NKVD carried out numerous missions of sabotage. After fall of Kiev, NKVD agents set fire to the Nazi headquarters and various other targets, eventually burning down much of the city center. Similar actions took place across the occupied Byelorussia and Ukraine.\n\nThe NKVD (later KGB) carried out mass arrests, deportations, and executions. The targets included both collaborators with Germany and non-Communist resistance movements such as the Polish Armia Krajowa and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army aiming to separate from the Soviet Union, among others. The NKVD also executed tens of thousands of Polish political prisoners in 1939–1941, including the Katyń massacre. NKVD units were also used to repress the prolonged partisan war in Ukraine and the Baltics, which lasted until the early 1950s.\n\n===Postwar operations===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}After the death of Stalin in 1953, the new Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev halted the NKVD purges. From the 1950s to the 1980s, thousands of victims were legally \"rehabilitated\" (i.e., acquitted and had their rights restored). Many of the victims and their relatives refused to apply for rehabilitation out of fear or lack of documents. The rehabilitation was not complete: in most cases the formulation was \"due to lack of evidence of the case of crime\". Only a limited number of persons were rehabilitated with the formulation \"cleared of all charges\".\n\nVery few NKVD agents were ever officially convicted of the particular violation of anyone's rights. Legally, those agents executed in the 1930s were also \"purged\" without legitimate criminal investigations and court decisions. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade) a small number of ex-NKVD agents living in the Baltic states were convicted of crimes against the local population.\n\n===Intelligence activities===\nThese included:\n\n* Establishment of a widespread spy network through the Comintern.* Operations of Richard Sorge, the \"Red Orchestra\", Willi Lehmann, and other agents who provided valuable intelligence during World War II.* Recruitment of important UK officials as agents in the 1940s.* Penetration of British intelligence (MI6) and counter-intelligence (MI5) services.* Collection of detailed nuclear weapons design information from the U.S. and Britain.* Disruption of several confirmed plots to assassinate Stalin.* Establishment of the People's Republic of Poland and earlier its communist party along with training activists, during World War II. The first President of Poland after the war was Bolesław Bierut, an NKVD agent.\n\n=== Soviet economy ===\nThe extensive system of labor exploitation in the Gulag made a notable contribution to the Soviet economy and the development of remote areas. Colonization of Siberia, the North and Far East was among the explicitly stated goals in the very first laws concerning Soviet labor camps. Mining, construction works (roads, railways, canals, dams, and factories), logging, and other functions of the labor camps were part of the Soviet planned economy, and the NKVD had its own production plans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe most unusual part of the NKVD's achievements was its role in Soviet science and arms development. Many scientists and engineers arrested for political crimes were placed in special prisons, much more comfortable than the Gulag, colloquially known as sharashkas. These prisoners continued their work in these prisons. When later released, some of them became world leaders in science and technology. Among such sharashka members were Sergey Korolev, the head designer of the Soviet rocket program and first human space flight mission in 1961, and Andrei Tupolev, the famous airplane designer. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was also imprisoned in a sharashka, and based his novel The First Circle on his experiences there.\n\nAfter World War II, the NKVD coordinated work on Soviet nuclear weaponry, under the direction of General Pavel Sudoplatov. The scientists were not prisoners, but the project was supervised by the NKVD because of its great importance and the corresponding requirement for absolute security and secrecy. Also, the project used information obtained by the NKVD from the United States.\n\n==People's Commissars==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"Show me the man and I'll find you the crime.\"|source=—Lavrentiy Beria.}}The agency was headed by a people's commissar (minister). His first deputy was the director of State Security Service (GUGB).* 1934-1936 Genrikh Yagoda, both people's commissar of Interior and director of State Security* 1936-1938 Nikolai Yezhov, people's commissar of Interior** 1936-1937 Yakov Agranov, director of State Security (as the first deputy)** 1937-1938 Mikhail Frinovsky, director of State Security (as the first deputy)** 1938-1938 Lavrentiy Beria, director of State Security (as the first deputy)* 1938-1945 Lavrentiy Beria, people's commissar of Interior** 1938-1941 Vsevolod Merkulov, director of State Security (as the first deputy)** 1941-1943 Vsevolod Merkulov, director of State Security (as the first deputy)* 1945-1946 Sergei Kruglov, people's commissar of Interior\n\nNote: In the first half of 1941 Vsevolod Merkulov transformed his agency into separate commissariat (ministry), but it was merged back to the people's commissariat of Interior soon after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1943 Merkulov once again split his agency this time for good.\n\n==Officers==\nAndrei Zhukov has singlehandedly identified every single NKVD officer involved in 1930s arrests and killings by researching a Moscow archive. There are just over 40,000 names on the list.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Soviet Union}}* Mass killings under Communist regimes* 10th NKVD Division (Soviet Union)* Hitler Youth conspiracy, an NKVD case pursued in 1938, later found to be baseless* NKVD special camps, internment camps set up at the end of World War II in eastern Germany (often in former Nazi POW or concentration camps) and other areas

A cover story of the final week of shooting for the 1970 American drama directed by Paul Bogart \"Halls of Anger\"\n\n{{quotation | \"Black extras get $13.20 a day -whites a minimum of $29.15.\" \"Our dressing rooms aren't integrated.\" Tell'im what they did to Ta-Tanisha.\" Cal Told me about Ta-Tanisha, the black actress who had protested because she didn't have as nice a dressing room as her white \"opposite number,\" [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829986/ Pat Stich], nor could she use the telephone on the set. To Ta-Ta, Cal said it was the same crap all over again. They can use the phones. We're still in the boondocks.\" Ta-Ta was so hurt, she broke down and cried, he said. We understood how she felt. She was being treated unfairly.\" - Budd Schulberg, Life Magazine Aug 21, 1970 }}\n\n{{quotation |[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829986/ Pat Stich], a well-bred, sensitive young actress, became almost tearful as she talked: \"This has been a very strange experience for me. I'm not really over it yet. I came in the first morning looking forward to meeting black actresses I'd be working with. But when I introduced myself, Ta-Ta and the others just stared at me. It was very spooky-I wanted to be friends but they wouldn't let me in. As we worked up to the scene where they tear my clothes off, I heard rumors that I would be in for a surprise that wasn't in the script. I was terrified I went to Mr. Bogart. I'd been nervous about the nude scene anyway. I'm afraid Mr. Bogart got angry with me. He said this was just a scene in a movie, that he'd stage it realistically without letting it get out of control, he'd make that clear to Ta-Ta and the others also. When he finally did the scene a strange thing happened. It didn't come off as violently as it should have. Maybe we'd all been so uptight. Ta-Ta and the black kids seemed to hold back too much. I guess we were all a little self-conscious. If all this was in a movie script, I suppose Ta-Ta and I would make up and there'd be some hope at the end. But it didn't work out that way. To be absolutely frank, after this experience I feel I have to reexamine my attitude toward black people. I don't mean hate them because they gave me a bad time. It's just so much more complex than I had anticipated.\" - Budd Schulberg, Life Magazine Aug 21, 1970 }}\n\n{{quotation | Said Ta-Tanisha, \"I think if I'd realized what they were putting down, I wouldn't have taken this job. Hollywood isn't ready to treat black people as people. A lot of times I felt like quitting. There's still a double standard. The studio is still Whitey's turf. Then this script I don't think white writers can ever write for blacks. They'll never know how we feel or think or talk. That scene where we we're supposed to strip the white kid in the john. I resented it. That's Whitey's idea of us. Of course, I realize it's box office, but I couldn't believe that line we had to say, \"We wanna see if you're blond all over.\" I can see a fight, with slapping and hair-pulling, but the way it was written it didn't seem true or fair to my people-\" Budd Schulberg, Life Magazine Aug 21, 1970 }}\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n\n===Television film===\n{{Empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Television Series===\n}| Marcia| Omega One Season 1, Episode 10 |-| 1974| {{sortname|Cannon (TV series)|}}| Susan Wyatt| Voice from the Grave Season 4, Episode 3 |-| 1973| {{sortname|Love,| American Style}}| Karen | (segment \"Love and the Hot Spell\") Season 4, Episode 18 |-| 1973| {{sortname|Griff (TV series)|}}| Gracie Newcombe| Season 1 Episode 1-13 |-| 1972| {{sortname|The|Rookies}}| Shirley | A Bloody shade of blue Season 1, Episode 13 |-| 1972| {{sortname|The|Loner}}| Julio| Season 1 Episode 1-13 |-| 1972| {{sortname|All|in the Family}}| Tammy Robinson| Gloria and the Riddle Season 3, Episode 4 |-| 1971| {{sortname|Insight|}}| Barbara| [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611459/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_15 Bird on the Mast] |-| 1970| {{sortname|Mannix|}}| Hally| The Mouse that died Season 4, Episode 5 |-| 1970| {{sortname|Medical| Center|Medical Center (TV series)}}| Louise| The Clash Season 2, Episode 5 |-| 1970| {{sortname|Love,| American Style}}| Bonnie | (segment \"Love and Las Vegas\") Season 1, Episode 21 |-| 1969| {{sortname|The| New People}}| Carrie | A Bride in Basic Black: the Courtship Season 1, Episode 9 |-| 1969| {{sortname|The| Good Guys|The Good Guys (1968 TV series)}}| Sylvia| The Splitting Headache Season 1, Episode 22 |-| 1969| {{sortname|Judd| for the Defense}}| Ethel| An Elephant in a Cigar Box Season 2, Episode 21 |-| 1968| {{sortname|The| Mothers-In-Law}}| Car-hop| The Hombre Who Came to Dinner: Part 1 Season 1, Episode 18 |-| 1966| {{sortname|Hawk (TV series)|}}| Joyce Walters| Some Devil Whispered in His Ear Season 1, Episode 14 |-|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stich, Patricia}}Category:1940 birthsCategory:American television actressesCategory:Living peopleCategory:American film actresses","tags":["American","deathdate","age"],"dateCreated":1496680662179,"dateModified":1496680662179},{"id":43740528,"title":"2014–15 Eastern Washington Eagles men's basketball team","text":"{{Infobox NCAA team season |Mode=Basketball |Year=2014–15 |Prev year=2013–14 |Next year=2015–16 |Team=Eastern Washington Eagles |Image=Eastern Washington University wordmark.svg |ImageSize=200 |Conference=Big Sky Conference |Division= |ShortConference=Big Sky |CoachRank= |APRank= |Record=26–9 |ConfRecord=14–4 |HeadCoach=Jim Hayford |HCYear = 4th |AsstCoach1=Shantay Legans |AsstCoach2=Alex Pribble |AsstCoach3=David Riley |AsstCoach4= |StadiumArena=Reese Court |Champion= Big Sky regular season co–champions<br>Big Sky Tournament champions |BowlTourney= NCAA Tournament |BowlTourneyResult=Round of 64}}{{2014–15 Big Sky men's basketball standings}}The 2014–15 Eastern Washington Eagles men's basketball team represented Eastern Washington University during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

The interchange serves the nearby residential estates of Telok Blangah and Bukit Purmei and also the commercial buildings in Bukit Merah Central. It is currently the only bus interchange in Singapore that does not have a direct link to an MRT Station. However, several services link commuters to nearby MRT stations from the interchange. Services 5, 16 and 851 link the interchange to Tiong Bahru, Service 132 links to Redhill, while Service 176 links to Telok Blangah.\n\n== Government Contracting Model ==\n\nThe SMRT services were split into 3 packages: 167 under Sembawang-Yishun, 176 under Choa Chu Kang-Bukit Panjang and 851 under Seletar.

There are a few local shops, and there used to be a three-screen movie theatre, Capitol Cinema, there before it was closed down in 2001.\n\nIt should be stressed that \"Pelham\" does not appear on any maps, nor is it officially recognised, and that the term is used only locally to describe the area surrounding the former site of the Pelham Arms Pub landmark by attributing the name of the pub to the area. This appears to happen frequently in Birmingham, with other examples being \"The Fox And Goose\" and \"The Scott Arms\".\n\nDuring 2006 and 2007, Birmingham City Council launched a housing improvement scheme which involved improving hundreds of properties in the Hodge Hill area, which therefore encompassed \"Pellham\". 328 houses received heating, 386 received new windows, 370 received rainwater goods and 393 received new doors.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|52.4881|-1.8404|region:GB-BIR|display=title}}\n\nCategory:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands\n\n{{WestMidlands-geo-stub}}","tags":["term","the","proximity"],"dateCreated":1496681089562,"dateModified":1496681089562},{"id":44963992,"title":"The Creek of the Four Graves","text":"{{wikisource|The Creek of the Four Graves}}\n\n\"The Creek of the Four Graves\" is a poem by Australian writer Charles Harpur that was first published in three parts in The Weekly Register of Politics, Facts and General Literature on 9 August, 16 August and 23 August 1845.\n\nThe author then published an erratum in the same paper on 30 August 1845 which corrects what appears to be a misprinting.\n\nIt was later included in the author's poetry collection The Bushrangers, a Play in Five Acts, and Other Poems (1853), and was subsequently reprinted in various newspapers, magazines and poetry anthologies (see below).\n\nHarpur continued to revise the poem throughout his life. His widow, Mary Harpur, authorised a version for inclusion in the poet's collection Poems (1883).\n\n==Reception==\n\nIn a review of The Bushrangers, a Play; and Other Poems by Charles Harpur, a writer in The Maitland Mercury, and Hunter River General Advertiser, 14 May 1853 stated: \" \"The Creek of the Four Graves\" is a very fine piece of narrative and descriptive poetry combined, and would alone entitle the author to be held a true poet.\"\n\nIn a review of an 1899 edition of Poems by Charles Harpur in Freeman's Journal, the writer opined: \" 'The Creek of the Four Graves' is a noteworthy performance not only in Australian verse, but also in modern English literature. An affected fad of the local bardling is local colour, but to use it properly he should study the way Harpur has used it in the poem mentioned.\"\n\nThe Oxford Companion to Australian Literature states: \"Its story of a group of settlers murdered by natives is presented with individuality and force. Set in the Hawkesbury district and the Blue Mountains, the poem combines a realistic narrative with effective description of the local Australian scene.\"\n\n== Further publications ==\n\n* The Bushrangers, a Play in Five Acts, and Other Poems by Charles Harpur (1853)* Poems by Charles Harpur (1883) * Australian Ballads and Rhymes : Poems Inspired by Life and Scenery in Australia and New Zealand (1888) edited by Douglas Sladen * A Century of Australian Song (1888) edited by Douglas Sladen * Bards in the Wilderness : Australian Colonial Poetry to 1920 (1970) edited by Adrian Mitchell and Brian Elliott * The Penguin Book of Australian Verse (1972) edited by Harry Payne Heseltine* The Poetical Works of Charles Harpur (1984) edited by Elizabeth Perkins* Cross-Country : A Book of Australian Verse (1984) edited by John Barnes and Brian McFarlane * Charles Harpur, Selected Poetry and Prose (1986) edited by Michael Ackland * A Collection of Australian Bush Verse (1989) edited by Peter Antill-Rose * The Poet's Discovery : Nineteenth Century Australia in Verse (1990) edited by Richard Douglas Jordan and Peter Pierce * The Penguin Book of 19th Century Australian Literature (1993) edited by Michael Ackland * Australian Verse : An Oxford Anthology (1998) edited by John Leonard* An Anthology of Australian Poetry to 1920 (2007) edited by John Kinsella* The Puncher & Wattmann Anthology of Australian Poetry (2009) edited by John Leonard\n\n==Notes==\n\nThe version of the poem text is that found in The Poetical Works of Charles Harpur (1984) edited by Elizabeth Perkins.\n\n==See also==\n* 1845 in poetry* List of years in Australian literature* Australian literature\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Creek of the Four Graves, The}}Category:Australian poemsCategory:1845 poems","tags":["below","Weekly","the"],"dateCreated":1496681089600,"dateModified":1496681089600},{"id":45204814,"title":"Development of The Last of Us","text":"{{DISPLAYTITLE:Development of The Last of Us}}The development of The Last of Us, an action-adventure survival horror video game, began after Uncharted 2: Among Thieves{{'}} release in October 2009.

In the game, players assume control of Joel, tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States, in an attempt to create a potential cure against an infection to which Ellie is immune. Creative director Neil Druckmann was inspired to include Infected as a main feature of the game after discovering the Cordyceps fungi. His story, set twenty years after the outbreak starts and much of civilization is destroyed, explored the possibility of the fungi infecting humans.\n\nThough Ellie was initially intended to be Joel's daughter, the team found this to be too limiting in terms of further character development. The team chose Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie, respectively. Providing both the voice and motion capture of the characters, Baker and Johnson assisted the team to develop the characters and help refine the story. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game, and all other elements were developed around it. Various other characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision.\n\nThe Last of Us features an original score, composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla. Known for his minimalist approach to composing, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. Naughty Dog took a similar minimalist approach to other elements of the game, including the action, sound design and art design. The sound department began working early on the sound of the Infected, in order to achieve the best work possible. A similar direction was taken by the art department, whose designs influenced other elements of development. Naughty Dog overhauled their game engine for some elements, particularly lighting and animations.\n\nThe Last of Us was officially announced in 2011; it was heavily promoted and widely anticipated. Naughty Dog missed the original release date, delaying the game in order for further polishing. Naughty Dog marketed the game through video trailers and press demonstrations, announcing specific details about the game as development continued. Various special edition versions were released, along with a comic book featuring characters from the game.\n\n== Production ==\n{{multiple image| footer = Bruce Straley (left) and Neil Druckmann (right) were chosen to lead development on The Last of Us, as game director and creative director, respectively.| image1 = Bruce Straley PAX Prime 2014.jpg| width1 = 145| alt1 = A 35-year-old man with short brown hair, smiling and looking at something to the right of the camera.| image2 = Neil Druckmann SDCC 2014.jpg| width2 = 150| alt2 = A 35-year-old man with curly black hair talking into a microphone, looking at something to the left of the camera.}}Preliminary work on The Last of Us, under the codename \"Project Thing\" or \"T1\", began after the release of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves in October 2009. For the first time in the company's history, developer Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011), the other began work on The Last of Us. In order to run the two teams smoothly, co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann to lead development on The Last of Us. Straley, who was employed at Naughty Dog in March 1999, was selected to lead the project based on his experience and his work on previous projects, while Druckmann, an employee since 2004, was chosen for his determination and talent for design.\n\n=== Story and setting ===\nAs a student at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with creating a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.\n\nThe Infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus; Straley attributed this to the team's focus on the characters, as opposed to the virus. They preferred to explain the events through subtext, rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection. Straley compared the subtext included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite (2013). He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry, which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry. \"I've seen enough good stories in books and film. Now I want to see them in video games,\" said Straley. The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance. Throughout development, the team assured everyone that the Infected were strictly different from zombies.\n\nIn order to make the game as realistic as possible, the team conducted extensive research for the setting. Taking influences from Alan Weisman's The World Without Us (2007), Naughty Dog created a world that would force players to make decisions and utilize their limited supplies effectively. In his research, Druckmann found inspiration in real historical events; the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic illustrated the depths of self-protection and paranoia capable by humans under threat of extinction, while the polio epidemic of the 1880s demonstrated the influences of socioeconomic classes when assigning blame in a great disaster. Druckmann and Straley have also cited Amy Hennig's \"perfectionist mindset\" and dedication to characters as an inspiration for the game's story; Hennig worked as head writer and creative director on the Uncharted series (2007–11). The team also took inspiration from Gravity (2013), in terms of the game's simplicity and intensity. \n\nWhen writing the script, Druckmann tried to exclude \"fancy dialogue\", keeping everything \"short and natural\". Community strategist Eric Monacelli has stated that the narrative's overarching themes are \"love, loyalty and redemption\", assuring their importance in the game, and fellow community strategist Arne Meyer said that the game's violence fit the narrative. Straley reiterated this, stating \"you have to have the dark to have the light\". Game designer Anthony Newman stated that the game deals with how people would react under pressure in extreme situations, which is represented through the violence and combat. The team felt interested in the story's dark themes juxtaposed against the \"beautiful\" settings.\n\nright\n\nA major motif present throughout the game is that \"life goes on\". A scene near the end of the game, in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, is referenced by many journalists as the denouement of this motif. Concept artist John Sweeney wrote that the scene was designed to \"reignite [Ellie's] lust for life\", triggering her curiosity and forgetting the surrounding struggle and death. He explained that the scene originally involved zebras, but were replaced by giraffes due to their gentleness and elegance, stating that they were \"the most remarkable thing Ellie could possibly encounter\". Druckmann felt that the sequence \"works because of all the horrible things\" encountered beforehand. IGN's Lucy O'Brien wrote that the scene acts as a reminder of Ellie's age, despite having been outwardly \"stripped of any semblance of a childhood\", and Kotaku writer Kirk Hamilton found the scene to be a resemblance of hope for Ellie, having clearly suffered post-traumatic stress following her encounter with David.\n\nIn regards to the ending, the team intended for it to be open to interpretation. Straley has stated that it's \"not your typical ending, but it’s still a nice resolution\". Both he and Druckmann stated their frustration when players told them they wanted a choice at the game's ending; Straley said that most of these players told him they would have chosen the same ending as the game anyway. Early in the game's development, the team envisioned an ending in which Ellie was forced to kill someone in order to save the incapacitated Joel; this ending was scrapped, as the team felt that it was not conforming to the character arcs. While the game's focus testers hated the ending, suggesting alternative methods, Druckmann continued with it; when the game's music and gameplay became closer to completion, the focus testers began appreciating the ending more. When discussing the ending, VentureBeat writer Dean Takahashi referenced the quote \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire\", from Schindler's List (1993), highlighting its inaccuracy: \"You save a life and doom the whole world,\" he wrote.\n\n=== Character development ===\n{{Further information|List of The Last of Us characters}}{{multiple image| align = left| footer = Troy Baker (left) and Ashley Johnson (right) portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, in The Last of Us.| image1 = Troy baker taiyoucon 2011 cropped.jpg| width1 = 130| alt1 = A 34-year-old man with spiky blonde hair, smiling at something to the left of the camera.| image2 = AshleyJohnson cropped.jpg| width2 = 150| alt2 = A 30-year-old woman with long, blonde hair, smiling at someone to the right of the camera.}}Joel is voiced by veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded later in a studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly to the development of the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary amount of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping, with Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.\n\nThough Druckmann initially wrote the character of Joel using inspiration from Josh Brolin's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men (2007), which he saw as \"very quiet, very cool under pressure\", Baker's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the character in a different way. Ultimately, the narrative became an exploration of how willing a father is to save a child; initially, Joel is willing to sacrifice himself, before evolving where he is willing to sacrifice his friends, until finally feeling that he would sacrifice all of humanity in order to save Ellie. Druckmann felt that players, specifically parents, would be able to relate to Joel's character and his bonding with Ellie. Baker believes that Joel discovers morality throughout the game's narrative, working out the difference between loss and sacrifice, and his true personality begins to show. When auditioning for the role, Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had \"few moral lines left to cross\", which became the \"anchor point\" to the character for him. Baker found great difficulty in filming the game's prologue, which features scenes with Joel and his daughter Sarah, portrayed by Hana Hayes. Upon later viewing of the first day of footage from the scene, Druckmann felt that it could still be improved. When filming the scene again, Druckmann explained to Baker how to perform it, and felt that it was the best take upon doing so. Though Baker initially found the take too \"mechanical\", he retroactively realised that he had been previously trying to impress audiences by his acting, and that it was \"not what the scene needed\".\n\nWhen portraying Ellie, Johnson faced challenges in performing scenes that made her feel uncomfortable. \"There were some days when we would shoot things that even at my age made me feel a little uncomfortable,\" Johnson described. Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie, and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a \"beautiful\" relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never included in the final game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view.\n\n{{multiple image| align = right| image1 = Annie Wersching 2009.jpg| width1 = 130| alt1 = A 31-year-old woman with long, brown hair, smiling with her head tilted at someone holding a microphone to the left of the camera.| image2 = Nolan North by Gage Skidmore.jpg| width2 = 138| alt2 = A 44-year-old man with short, brown hair, talking into a microphone, and smiling to the right of the camera.| footer = Annie Wersching (left) and Nolan North (right) portrayed Tess and David, respectively, in The Last of Us.}}\n\nThe character of Tess was originally intended to be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team found it difficult to believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story.The character of Bill, portrayed by W. Earl Brown, is revealed to be homosexual at one point in the game. Druckmann initially left this vague in the script, but was inspired at the script read-through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill's sexuality. To make Bill interesting, Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival, it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for. Bill's role in the game was also to voice Joel's concerns about escorting Ellie, as Joel does not voice them. \"[T]he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can actually say that to Joel, and warn Joel about that stuff,\" Druckmann said.Veteran voice actor Nolan North, who portrays protagonist Nathan Drake in Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, was chosen to play the role of David in the game. When approached by Druckmann about the role, North immediately accepted the part, appreciating its diversity from his previous acting roles. To portray the character, North approached his personality from multiple perspectives, viewing David as a \"survivor\". North empathized with David, stating that most of David's actions were understandable when considering the apocalyptic situation. He felt that David was initially attempting to protect Ellie, who was viewed as a \"glimmer of hope\".\n\nThe team felt that the post-apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave them the opportunity to better develop the characters. Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games, the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us. They also took inspiration from the books The Road (2006) and City of Thieves (2008), and the film No Country for Old Men, noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration. \"[W]e can make you as a player feel more of what it's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you take is a conscious choice that's going to make or break your existence,\" said Straley. The team also felt that the \"pressures of the world\" allowed them to better develop their characters. They felt that the pressure forced the characters to make interesting decisions, allowing better development.\n\n=== Technical and gameplay development ===\nFor The Last of Us, the team had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The artificial intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, as opposed to the action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a \"burden\". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, considered one of the most important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. \"You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes,\" Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.\n\nThere are multiple features omitted from the game that the team considered typical of most video games, such as boss fights. A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around. The team also attempted to cause players to feel as though they are lacking, particularly in the supplies that they collect. \"You're not building yourself into a tank,\" said Straley. This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay, such as the weightlessness of the animations, and the melee combat mechanic. To further add to the realism, the team developed the game's combat mechanic in a way that forces players to spend more time planning. They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected, despite their belief that retreating is the \"anti-video game play mechanic\". The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense, intentionally moving the camera closer to players, in order for them to \"feel every strike\". The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices, in terms of combat, stealth and resource management, allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters.\n\nMany gameplay elements from the Uncharted games were excluded from The Last of Us due to the nature of the latter. The team made Joel more \"grounded and less nimble\" than Uncharted{{'}}s Nathan Drake. The camera angle and melee system were also altered to fit with the team's intention of the game. Some gameplay features were inspired by the game's post-apocalyptic nature; for example, a task involving spatial problem solving was inspired by the prior inclusion of a strong water current that obstructs players. The team also felt that No Country for Old Men inspired them in terms of the minimalism, wanting to \"get more intimate\" with the gameplay scenarios. The team decided to include various optional paths for players to use. While at one point they felt that the additional content was useless, the team eventually felt that it feels \"natural and organic\".\n\nThe game's online multiplayer mode features three game types; the team opted to limit the amount of game types, as opposed to creating an abundance of them, in order to create a \"deeper game experience\". The multiplayer mode was inspired by the combat encounters of the single-player campaign; the team aimed to recreate the slow pace of the encounters, and maintain a similar crafting system. This was achieved by making weapons lethal, and placing crafting items in strategic locations across the map, which was intended to result in stealthy gameplay and careful selection of ambushes. It also emphasized the stealth and teamwork elements of the mode. Lead multiplayer designer Erin Daly felt that the slower pace was difficult to achieve in a multiplayer environment, stating that \"in most multiplayer shooters ... players sprint around at high speeds and spray bullets at anything that moves\". In addition, the multiplayer was designed to support different play styles; while some players prefer to act as sniper, others opt to perform as support. Adding a revive system—when players take a significant amount of damage, they slowly crawl around while bleeding to death—created a large consequence to death; losing team members is intended to be a significant loss to players. When designing the multiplayer, the team wanted players to have very little information regarding the location of the threats, while still giving a minor indication of the location. Daly attributed this to the importance of threat detection in a competitive experience, particularly when the lethality is high. The in-game purchasing system was designed to be akin to a role-playing game by allocating a set of spendable points.\n\nleft\n\nFor the game's character sculpting and rigging, the team introduced various new elements that were not used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found that the creation of the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To retain the shape of the face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.\n\n{{Wide image|The Last of Us UI design changes.jpg|500px|The various iterations that the user interface design underwent throughout development.|250px|right|alt=Four images side-by-side, displaying different version of a user interface design. All designs features guns available to players; the guns are displayed in a circle in the first two images, and in squares in the final two images (the squares are translucent in the third image, and transparent in the final image).}}The user interface design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis originally intended to integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, it was decided that the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered \"clunky and slow\", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. \"This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed,\" Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. \"We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive,\" lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.\n\n=== Art design ===\nWhen designing the game from an artistic viewpoint, the team took various pieces of work as inspiration. Robert Polidori's photographs of Lower Ninth Ward following Hurricane Katrina were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. \"[Polidori] did these amazingly beautiful, horrific photos... it's not just decay and rot and post-apocalyptic grey, it's a human world that we're playing with when we portray this destruction,\" said Straley. The concept of post-apocalyptic environments was considered a \"starting point\" for the artists. The art team also strived to achieve realism within every piece of art. Straley explained that the artists \"would be like, I'm going to make this the most awesome fucking wall ever,\" in terms of creating attractive environments. The art department were forced to fight for things that they wished to include, due to the high demand during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The artistic composition of the game's locations was also a feature strongly focused on, in order to evoke varying emotions from players. In the final weeks of development, roles from the art department were undertaken by other members of the team; for example, Straley hand-arranged the texts on the game's training screens, a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual. \"I have never even heard of a game director doing that! That's like... an intern task,\" Wells said.\n\nWhen creating the look of the Infected, the art team cycled through various iterations. Some early ideas included the Infected looking like aliens or zombies. The final design was chosen when lead character artist Michael Knowland incorporated images of diseases and fungal growth onto a human. He expressed the difficulty in changing the art from 2D to 3D, which would allow viewing from different angles. The process of sending completed concept art to the lighting and visual effects artists, who re-create the art within the game's engine. Due to the lack of artificial light sources in the game's world, the team was forced to work with natural light. To achieve high quality lighting, they used lightmaps. The use of lightmaps led to various problems, such as the discontinuities in the lighting; this was fixed by slightly modifying the texel intensities. When characters were added to scenes, they initially looked out of place; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this.\n\nThe game's opening credits were directed by Kevin Joelson and designed by Henry Hobson. Original concept development for the opening sequence began in late January 2013, and full production began in March 2013. Though the team initially intended for the game to omit opening credits, they were later added to \"bridge the gap\" between the game's prologue and the following scene, a cut that was previously deemed \"too sudden\" without opening credits. Sony San Diego produced the opening credits, using time-lapse photography to record the growth of fungus over multiple days; only the spores at the end of the credits are computer-generated. The sequence was inspired by Planet Earth, which featured similar concepts.\n\n=== Music and sound production ===\n{{Main|Music of The Last of Us}}Throughout development, Druckmann and Straley had been compiling various musical tracks that they found inspirational. When searching for a composer to work on the game's music, they realised that many of the compiled tracks were composed by Gustavo Santaolalla. Straley described Santaolalla's music as \"organic instrumentation, minimalist, dissonance and resonance with the sounds\". As a result, Sony reached out to Santaolalla, who agreed to work on the game's soundtrack. After hearing the game's pitch, Santaolalla was excited to work on the game; he previously wanted to work on video games, but refused to work on those without a focus on story and characters.\n\nthumb\n\nDue to Santaolalla's stance on composing music—he lacks knowledge in reading and writing sheet music, preferring to simply record—he began working on The Last of Us early in development. To give Santaolalla a point to base his music, Druckmann simply told him about the story and themes, as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom, feeling it assisted in the composing. To compose, Santaolalla felt the need to \"go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic\". To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. For The Last of Us, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique tunes, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical of action music in other games, stating that it's \"relatively low-key\", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, \"The Last of Us\", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed.\n\nThe sound design team began working on the game early in development, in order to achieve the best results; they immediately realised that it would be challenging. Early in development, Druckmann told the sound team to \"make it subtle\", and underplay ideas. Audio lead Phillip Kovats was excited to completely create all sounds; no sounds were carried across from previous games. The team looked at ways to create sounds from a naturalistic point-of-view, and how to introduce minimalism into a game. By doing so, they found that it added feelings of tension, loss and hope, and that the game appeared to be a typical \"action game\" without the minimalism approach. They used a high dynamic range, allowing them the opportunity to inform players on tactical information, and locations to explore. The game's sound design was created to reflect a more \"grounded\" and subtle mood than Uncharted, particularly focusing on the lack of sound. Taking inspiration from No Country for Old Men, the team attempted to \"do more with less\"; Kovats said that the team was trying to tell a story by \"going for a reductive quality\". Straley stated that the audio is vital to some scenes in the game; \"It's more about the psychology of what's happening on the audioscape than what you're seeing,\" he stated. He felt that this decision allowed a more impactful and meaningful effect with sound occurred. The sound team also attempted to portray the game's dark themes through sound. The team felt that it was important to let sounds play for as long as possible in the game, drawing tension. The team used a propagation technique to help players determine the exact locations of enemies, using this as a tactical advantage. This system, created by the team at Naughty Dog, is processed at random in the game engine. For the game's audio, the engine throws out 1500–2500 ray casts per frame; though most games avoid this, the game's engine allowed it to work. The team spent a lot of time recording sounds for the game, namely doors, and rusty metal. Sound designer Neil Uchitel traveled to Rio de Janeiro, discovering locations to record sounds; he recorded chickens, which were used in the game as the voices of rats. The team continued to add and change the game's sounds until the end of development.\n\n{{Listen |filename = The Last of Us Clicker sound effect.ogg |title = Clicker sound effect |description = The development of the sound made by Clickers. The first sound, performed by voice actress Misty Lee, inspired the final sound effect implemented in the game. |pos = right |type = |alt = A 12-second audio sample of the sound effect made by the Clicker creatures in The Last of Us.}}To create the sound of the Clickers, the third stage of the Infected, the team found inspiration from a report on the journalism show 20/20 (1978–present) about blind children using clicking noises to communicate. \"We liked the idea of taking this benign sound and attributing it to something really scary,\" said Druckmann. In addition, the team wanted to reflect the creature's feeling of pain and suffering, attempting to balance it with a sense of creepiness. The sound team created the sound of the Clicker first, realising early that it was the most challenging. To create the sound, they hired voice actors to perform their renditions. When voice actress Misty Lee provided her own rendition, a noise that Kovats described as originating in the \"back of the throat\", Kovats and senior sound designer Derrick Espino agreed that it was what they wanted. Kovats then emulated the sound to feature in the game.\n\n== Business ==\n=== Announcement ===\nIn December 2011, prior to the announcement of the game, an Easter egg was found in Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception referencing the concept of The Last of Us on an in-game newspaper; Naughty Dog retroactively stated that the reference was supposed to be seen after the game's intended reveal at E3 in June 2011, but when the timing of the reveal itself was pushed to December, the team forgot to remove the reference. A few weeks before the game's announcement, a billboard in Times Square teased the game, naming it a \"PlayStation 3 exclusive you won't believe\". Sony officially unveiled the game on December 10, 2011, at the Spike Video Game Awards. Shortly after the unveiling, Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells revealed details about the game:\n\n{{quote|The Last of Us is a genre-defining experience that blends survival and action elements to tell a character-driven tale about a modern plague decimating mankind. Nature encroaches upon civilization, forcing remaining survivors to kill for food, weapons and whatever they can find. Joel, a ruthless survivor, and Ellie, a brave young teenage girl who is wise beyond her years, must work together to survive their journey across what remains of the United States.}}\n\nIn February 2013, Naughty Dog announced that The Last of Us would miss its intended release date of May 7, 2013, delaying it until June 14, 2013 to allow for further polishing. \"[I]nstead of cutting corners or compromising our vision, we came to the tough decision that the game deserved a few extra weeks to ensure every detail of The Last of Us was up to Naughty Dog’s internal high standards,\" Naughty Dog stated in a press release.\n\n=== Release trailers ===\n300px\n\nThe game was extensively marketed through video trailers. The game's first trailer was released alongside the game's full announcement, showcasing the game's concept, characters and setting. For this trailer, the team held extended discussions concerning features of the gameplay to include. They initially planned to omit the Infected from the first trailer, in order to sharpen the focus on the characters; they ultimately decided to include the Infected, as they felt that omitting them would arouse anticipation of their final reveal, trailing the focus away from the characters. For the final design of the trailer, the team attempted to incorporate as many gameplay features as possible, including human antagonism, melee implementation, stealth, and character relationships. The first game cinematic was released on May 15, 2012, depicting a scene in which Joel and Ellie are ambushed by hunters. This was followed by a second trailer titled \"The Sky has Turned Grey\", released on May 16. The trailer revealed a redesign of the character of Ellie; Druckmann revealed that this was to make her look more similar to actress Ashley Johnson. A game cinematic, introducing the character of Bill, was shown during the game's panel at San Diego Comic-Con International, on July 13.\n\nA third trailer was released during Gamescom on August 14, 2012, showcasing more of the game's environments and enemies. At the same event, a video was released, showcasing the process that cutscenes are developed, from the raw material to the final product. At PAX Prime 2012, Naughty Dog showcased a video demonstration of the game, displaying gameplay. A story trailer for the game was later shown during the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards, on December 7. A TV trailer for The Last of Us was broadcast following the third season finale of AMC's The Walking Dead on March 31, 2013. A trailer for the game's online multiplayer mode was released on June 4, showcasing the factions elements to the mode. The final pre-launch trailer was released on June 11, during E3 2013.\n\n=== Other marketing ===\nA demo for The Last of Us was included with all copies of God of War: Ascension, and was available from May 31, 2013 until the game's launch. To encourage pre-order sales, Naughty Dog collaborated with several retail outlets to provide special edition versions of the game. The \"Post-Pandemic Edition\" includes a unique case packaging, a statue of Joel and Ellie and unlock codes for additional content in the single-player and multiplayer modes. The \"Joel Edition\" and \"Ellie Edition\" include similar contents, but contain some features that are often differentiated by the characters.\n\nA four-issue comic book miniseries, titled The Last of Us: American Dreams, was published by Dark Horse Comics. Written by Druckmann and illustrated by Faith Erin Hicks, the comics serve as a prequel to the game, chronicling the journey of a younger Ellie and another young survivor Riley. The first issue was published on April 3, 2013, and a reprint became available on May 29, 2013; the second issue was published on the same day, followed by the third issue on June 26, and the fourth issue on July 31. All four issues were republished as a single package on October 30. The game's cover art was unveiled on December 9, 2012, featuring Ellie and Joel; the team fought to feature Ellie on the front cover, despite attempts from external influences to move the image to the back. \"I've been in discussions where we've been asked to push Ellie to the back and everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused,\" said Druckmann.\n\n== Notes and references ==\nNotes{{notelist}}\n\nReferences{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n}}\n\n{{The Last of Us}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\nLast of Us, TheCategory:The Last of UsCategory:Sony Interactive Entertainment","tags":["by","Ellie","efnAn"],"dateCreated":1496681089634,"dateModified":1496681089634},{"id":45376962,"title":"Mystrocnemis","text":"{{Taxobox| image =| regnum = Animalia| phylum = Arthropoda| classis = Insecta| ordo = Coleoptera| familia = Cerambycidae| subfamilia = Lamiinae| genus = Mystrocnemis| genus_authority = | subdivision_ranks = species| subdivision =}}Mystrocnemis is a genus of longhorn beetles of the subfamily Lamiinae, containing the following species:\n\n* Mystrocnemis allardi <small>Breuning, 1961</small>* Mystrocnemis analis <small>(Fahraeus, 1872)</small>* Mystrocnemis apicalis <small>Aurivillius, 1915</small>* Mystrocnemis atricollis <small>Breuning, 1953</small>* Mystrocnemis bicolor <small>Aurivillius, 1914</small>* Mystrocnemis flavoapicalis <small>Breuning, 1950</small>* Mystrocnemis flavovittata <small>Quedenfeldt, 1882</small>* Mystrocnemis fossulata <small>Breuning, 1956</small>* Mystrocnemis stictica <small>Aurivillius, 1914</small>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\nCategory:Saperdini\n\n{{Saperdini-stub}}","tags":["Mystrocnemis","containing","of"],"dateCreated":1496681089548,"dateModified":1496681089548},{"id":4586553,"title":"Baldwin High School","text":"Baldwin High School may refer to:\n\n*Baldwin Middle-Senior High School, Baldwin, Florida*Baldwin High School (Georgia), Milledgeville, Georgia*Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii*Baldwin High School (Kansas), Baldwin City, Kansas*Baldwin Senior High School (Michigan), Baldwin, Michigan*Baldwin Senior High School (New York), Baldwin, New York*Baldwin High School (Pennsylvania), Baldwin, Pennsylvania\n\n{{schooldis}}","tags":["School","Pennsylvania","High"],"dateCreated":1496681064906,"dateModified":1496681064906},{"id":45918,"title":"Between Planets","text":"{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}{{Infobox book| name = Between Planets| title_orig =| translator =| image = Bp51.jpg| caption = Cover of the first edition| author = Robert A.

Heinlein, originally serialized in Blue Book magazine in 1951 as \"Planets in Combat\". It was published in hardcover that year by Scribner's as part of the Heinlein juveniles.\n\n==Plot summary==\nA young man named Don Harvey leaves his dude ranch high school on Earth to go to his scientist parents on Mars. He visits an old family friend who asks him to deliver a ring to his father, but they are both later arrested by security forces. Harvey is released and given his ring back, after it has been examined; he is told that his friend has died of \"heart failure.\" It is only later that he realizes that all deaths can be described that way.\n\nHarvey boards a shuttle to a space station orbiting the Earth. The station doubles as a transshipment terminus and a military base, armed with missiles to keep restive nations in check. On the trip up, he befriends one of his fellow passengers, a Venusian \"dragon\" named Sir Isaac Newton. Sir Isaac is a renowned physicist who can speak English using a portable device.\n\nHarvey gets caught up in the Venusian war of independence when the station is captured by the colonials in a surprise raid. Most of the other travelers are sent back to Earth, while a few decide to join the rebels. Harvey is in a quandary. The spaceship to Mars has been confiscated, but he remains determined to get there, by way of Venus if necessary. Because he was born in space, with one parent from Venus and the other from Earth, he claims Venusian citizenship; more importantly, Sir Isaac vouches for him. He is allowed to tag along, which turns out to be very fortunate for Harvey. The rebels blow up the station to stir up trouble for the Earth government. When the shuttle returns to Earth with its radios disabled, the military assumes it has been booby-trapped and destroys it, killing all aboard.\n\nOn his arrival on Venus, Harvey finds that his Earth-backed money is now worthless. A banker lends him money, telling him to pay it forward. He gets a job washing dishes for his keep for Charlie, a Chinese immigrant who runs a small restaurant. He befriends a young woman, Isobel, when he tries to send a message to his parents. However, communication with Mars has been cut due to the hostilities. Harvey settles in to wait out the war, when the war comes to him.\n\nEarth sends a military force to put down the rebellion. The Venusian ships are destroyed in orbit and the ground forces are routed. Charlie is killed resisting the occupying soldiers. Harvey is rounded up and questioned by a senior security officer, who is very eager to get his hands on Harvey's ring. Luckily, Harvey had given it to Isobel for safekeeping and he does not know where she is or whether she is even alive. Before he can be interrogated with drugs, he escapes and joins the Venusian guerrilla forces.\n\nHarvey becomes an effective commando. In time, he is tracked down by the leaders of the resistance, who turn out to also be looking for the ring. Isobel and her father (who is an important member of the rebels) are safe at the very base where Harvey is taken.\n\nThe seemingly valueless ring turns out to be carrying the secret of scientific breakthroughs resulting from archeological studies of an extinct alien civilization on Mars. With Sir Isaac's assistance, it is used to build an advanced spaceship that is much faster than any other vessel in existence, with revolutionary weapons and defenses also derived from the new technology. As the only combat veteran with knowledge of the ship, christened Little David, Harvey is recruited for its maiden voyage, manning a self-destruct mechanism, with strict orders to blow up the ship if it is in danger of being captured. Little David intercepts and defeats a group of warships on their way to Mars to crush the revolt there. Afterwards, Harvey is probably reunited with his parents, although the story ends before then.\n\n==Astronomy==\nLike many science fiction works of its period, the novel depicts both Venus and Mars as suitable for human habitation. Since no interplanetary space probes had been launched at the time, neither the extreme pressure and temperature at the surface of Venus, nor the extremely low atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mars, were known to science. Even the length of the day on Venus was not yet known.\n\n==Reception==\nGroff Conklin reviewed the novel favorably, calling it \"a magnificently real and vivid Picture of the Possible.\" Boucher and McComas named it among the best sf novels of 1951, characterizing it as \"more mature than most 'adult' science fiction.\". P. Schuyler Miller praised the novel as \"very smoothly and logically put together,\" although he noted that it lacked the level of \"elaboration of background detail\" that he expected from Heinlein.\"\n\nSurveying Heinlein's juvenile novels, Jack Williamson characterized Between Planets as \"mov[ing] the series still farther from its juvenile origins toward grownup concerns.\" Although describing the plot as \"pretty traditional space opera,\" he praised the novel for its \"ably drawn\" characters, its \"well-imagined\" background, and its \"story told with zest.\" Williamson also noted that Heinlein closed the novel \"with a vigorous statement of his unhappiness with 'the historical imperative'\" leading to the loss of individual freedom as governmental organizations grew.\"\n\n==Cartoon==\nBetween Planets was serialized in Boys' Life magazine in 1978 as a monthly cartoon series. The story took some liberties — for instance, the \"Dragons\" of Venus were portrayed as humanoids and the planets' names were changed — but the spirit of the story was relatively faithful.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{isfdb title|id=6131|title=Between Planets}}* [http://picasaweb.google.com/sfscalemodels/BetweenPlanets# Scale model diorama depicting Sir Isaac and Don Harvey from Between Planets]* [https://gondica.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/reflections-on-between-planets-vietnam-on-venus/ A discussion on possible parallels between Between Planets and the 1946-54 Indochina War]\n\n{{Heinlein (Novel)}}\n\nCategory:1951 American novelsCategory:1950s science fiction novelsCategory:Children's science fiction novelsCategory:American science fiction novelsCategory:Novels by Robert A.

He earned a degree in Philosophy from the University of Salamanca in 1932. He was a Falangist from the beginning, and was awarded with the Palma de Plata by José Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1934. During those years, he was a journalist in the Falangist press and in the newspaper La Nación. He travelled as a correspondent to places like Ethiopia (during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War), where he met the German Wilhelm Oberbeil. Oberbeil was the one who introduced him to the Abwehr, a German military intelligence (information gathering) organization, in Berlin in 1935. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he was a prisoner in Larrínaga, Bilbao, but he succeeded in escaping. He get missed 11/03/2001 in locality and found dead a month later\n\n== Role in the Falange ==\nHe was a convinced Falangist. He began his involvement taking part in the Asturian miners' strike of 1934 as a reporter. He was awarded the above-mentioned prize, Palma de Plata, due to his work. It is important to highlight his work as a journalist in the Falangist press and in the newspaper La Nación. He was imprisoned in the prison of Bilbao, Larrínaga, for crimes against the Spanish Second Republic, because of his work as a gunman for the Falange (the Spanish Falangist movement). He was present at the time of the uprising of the rebel army on July 18, 1936. When he was due to be transferred he escaped from the prison and fled to the national zone. In 1937, he traveled to Salamanca as a correspondent at the front for an interview with Manuel Hedilla, National Leader of the Falange, who tried to gain support against those who had a sense of entitlement due to their proximity to José Antonio Primo de Rivera. The situation in Salamanca had divided the Nationalists in two. The Hedilla supporters, under the command of Agustín Aznar, Sancho Dávila and Rafael Dávila Garcerán, were backed by the Germans. Furthermore, rumors were spread from the headquarters of Francisco Franco to destroy and discredit both factions, before they then presented themselves as saviours. According to his memories, Alcázar de Velasco intuits this and therefore proposes, at least twice, to murder Franco.\n\nA few days later, a scuffle took place and two Falangists were killed. Francisco Franco is appointed to the position of maximum command by headquarters in order to unify the Nationalists and avoid an internal war. Alcázar is arrested for participating in the events, tried for \"military rebellion\" and sentenced to life imprisonment. After going through several prisons, he ended up in Fort San Cristobal, Pamplona. There, he was caught up in one of the major escapes of republican prisoners in the Spanish Civil War, and escaped to Pamplona to warn about the events. As a result, the sentence was reduced to just two years.\n\nIn January 1940 he was appointed press officer of the Institute of Political Studies in Madrid thanks to his friendship with Ramón Serrano. Alcazar decides to talk to the British Ambassador Samuel Hoare, presenting himself as a radical Falangist with opposing ideas to the Franco regime. In the summer of 1940 he travels to London, where he arrived as a press officer at the Spanish Embassy in London.\n\n== Cooperation with Nazi Germany ==\n\nIn January 1940, he meets Oberbeil due to his friendship with Ramón Serrano Suñer, who suggests that he goes to London as a spy for the German intelligence service Abwehr. While other Spaniard Miguel Piernavieja, takes charge of sending reports to the Germans, Alcázar de Velasco created a spy network in Spain. His main objective in this task was to inform about the traffic of British ships, to gain information from the staff of British embassies and, eventually, to come up with a plan in order to blow up the Rock of Gibraltar. To do this, Wilhelm Canaris came to Spain.\n\nPiernavieja was dismissed from his post because he led a lax life, and was sent to the Blue Division. Alcazar narrates in his memories that he usually visited the places that were bombed in London and gave information to the Germans for future attacks, and organized anti-Franco guerrillas in order to send them to Spain. The Spanish embassy in London did not have good security measures, so most of the information was intercepted by the MI5, the British Security Service.\n\nThat same year, in autumn, Alcázar made contact with Charles de Gaulle as a member of Abwehr during a mission in which Alcazar had to send several million pounds to help the Free France organization and to devalue the British currency.\n\nIn his memories, Alcázar de Velasco shows his thoughts about the World War and also shows his esoteric personality: a conflict between the hidden powers of Wel that were represented by the Nazis who defended European Civilization against the Jewish’ Kahal. He is profoundly anti-semitic and thinks that the allies and the Soviet Union form part of an international Jewish conspiracy.\n\nIn March 1941, Alcázar began working for Walter Schellenberg, who was the espionage boss of the SS, RSHA. Because of this, Alcázar got involved in Operation Willi, in which the people who worked for Walter Schellenberg tried to kidnap the Duke of Windsor in Portugal.\n\nIn 1944, he traveled to Germany and worked again for the SS and helped them purge the Abwehr, association which had been broken up due to the Solf case Solf Kreis) in February (of the same year). Alcázar stayed in Berlín until the end of World War II. He narrates in his memories that he stayed at the Chancellery bunker until the 24th April 1945. After that, he was able to escape to Switzerland and was repatriated to Spain.\n\nAfter his arrival in Spain, he kept working for the Nazis helping them escape from Germany. Most were Nazi leaders the most famous one being Martin Bormann.\n\n== Tõ Network ==\n\nÁngel Alcázar began working for the Japanese shortly after coming back from Madrid in what is known as his most ambitious project: the Tõ network (東機関).\n\nJapan desperately needed information on the allies; Japanese and German espionage networks in the United States were being dismantled and Japan needed agents to keep them informed, especially in the United States.\n\nThis need is what brought Spain into the picture since it had some hard to find qualities, such a close relationship with Latin America. That's why Ramón Serrano suggested to the Japanese that they hire Alcázar, they saw Alcázar as the right man for the job not only because of Serrano's recommendation, but also thanks to the fact that time was a scarce resource. They also took advantage of his espionage network in London that led to the future creation of another in the United States. That's how shortly after arriving in Madrid in early January, Alcázar began working for the Japanese by sending them reports entitled \"Tō Network\".\n\nThe Tō Network generated more information than any other espionage network in the United States. But it is important to emphasise that the quality was not as good as the quantity. The information that Alcázar was selling to the Japanese and the Germans left a lot to be desired, and most of this information was made up by Alcázar. However, the Japanese didn't seem to notice and even if they did, they preferred to keep receiving information, information that the Americans already knew were being sent out.\n\nAs they would reveal after the allied victory, the USA was always aware of Alcázar’s movements, while also undervaluing him as a spy. As was disclosed in the “Magic Summaries”, the info the Japanese had was always easily decoded by the USA since the beginning — this was thanks to the acquisition of the codes.\n\nThe Tõ network was made up, according to Alcázar's memories, of 21 agents. This, however, has always been the object of debate, as some authors are convinced that it was just an invention. Others, on the other hand, believed that the existence of these agents could be true.\n\nThe Tõ network lost all its credibility in an attempt to turn the tide of World War II at the beginning of 1943 when Alcázar and Suñer tried to make the Japanese believe that there was an attempt to make peace with the USA without Japan. The Japanese, alarmed by this turn of events, checked this information asking some of the participants (such as Ribbentrop). These participants denied any meeting of the sort. After this, Alcázar, and in less measure Suñer, lost their credibility in Japan. Strangely enough, even after this incident, Japan continued to buy information from Spain. It is believed that this was due to their extreme need for information on the enemy and, due to a shortage of resources, their inability to acquire it. The reason behind this plot was to make Japan attack Russia so that the tide of the war could change.\n\nJapan continued buying information from Alcázar until the end of the war, even though he was by then considered little more than a liar.\n\n== Activity after the war ==\nOnce the World War II finished, he worked as a journalist: first, for the newspaper La Tarde. Then, as a correspondent in Paris and Buenos Aires. Later, as the director of the Literary Supplement in a Mexican newspaper. After that, as a special reporter for a French press agency around the world. And lastly, for the Francoist press. However, in his memoirs he himself admits he did not abandon espionage until 1958.\n\nÁngel Alcázar de Velasco died in May 2001 at the age of 92 years in the locality.\n\n== List of works ==\n*\"Martín Borman did not die in Berlin: I took him to South América\", París, 1960.*\"Los 7 días de Salamanca\" Ed.

A wing three-quarter, Wilson represented {{Rut Auckland}} at a provincial level. He was called into the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, to tour Australia in 1910 because of Donald Cameron's withdrawal. He played a game against Wellington before he departed for Australia where he scored his only points for the All Blacks. He played in the first game in Australia but received an injury and did not appear again. \n\nAn all-round sportsman, Wilson was considered one of Auckland's fastest sprinters. He also captained the Ponsonby Cricket Club, as well as being a well-known swimmer and tennis player.\n\nIn World War I, Wilson enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in March 1915 and embarked for service overseas in August that year. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in August 1916, and was wounded in action during the Battle of the Somme on 17 September 1916. He died as a result of his wounds two days later.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He has also played for the New York Giants, winning Super Bowl XLVI with them in 2011. He played college football at Virginia.\n\n==Early years==\nChris Canty was born in The Bronx, New York. He grew up in the Baychester section of the borough until he moved to North Carolina at age 15. He did not play football until his junior year. Canty helped lead his team (Charlotte Latin School) to the North Carolina Independent Schools Athletic Association State Championship in 1999 on his way to earning All-Conference and All-State honors as a senior tight end and defensive end after recording 20 receptions for 400 yards and 89 tackles and seven sacks.\n\nHe finished his prep career with 161 tackles, 12 sacks and two fumble recoveries. He was also a two-year letterman and all-conference honoree for the basketball team.\n\n==College career==\nWhile at Virginia, Canty was a two-time second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection. He led all conference defensive linemen in tackles as a sophomore and junior.\n\n===Sophomore (2002)===\nIn 2002, despite missing three games due to injury, Canty finished his sophomore season with 86 tackles, four tackles for losses, four pass deflections, three quarterback pressures, three fumble recoveries and two sacks while starting eight-of-11 games.\n\n===Junior (2003)===\nIn 2003, Canty was named second-team All-ACC, Lineman of the Year in Virginia and recipient of the Ned McDonald Award as UVA's Most Outstanding Defensive Player after registering a career-high 104 tackles, 12 tackles for losses, 12 pressures and four sacks. He became only the second down lineman in school history to record more than 100 tackles in a season. His schoolwork also helped him earn All-ACC Academic honors.\n\n===Senior (2004)===\nIn 2004, he received his bachelor's degree in African American studies in May and took graduate course work in secondary education during his senior year. Canty's season was cut short in the fourth game of the season when he tore his ACL, MCL and PCL in his left knee. At the time, he had posted 30 tackles, seven tackles for losses, a sack and a forced fumble.\n\n===Eye injury===\nCanty suffered a serious eye injury at a nightclub in Scottsdale, Arizona, in late January 2005. While Canty said he was nothing more than a bystander in an altercation, he evidently was hit with a glass bottle in left eye, forcing him to have immediate surgery to repair a detached retina.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Dallas Cowboys===\nCanty was drafted in the fourth round (132nd overall pick) of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. After entering his senior season as a potential first round draft choice, he fell because of the knee injury he suffered as a senior, as well as a detached retina in his left eye, that was inflicted in the spring prior to the draft. The Cowboys traded their fifth round pick in 2005 and a fourth rounder in 2006 to the Philadelphia Eagles in order to move up. Canty signed a three-year, $1.3 million contract with the Cowboys.\n\nAfter working throughout the spring and summer to rehabilitate his knee and recover from the injured retina, Canty was on the field one week into training camp. As a rookie, he registered 35 tackles (24 solo), was second on the team with five tackles for loss and tied for fourth on the club with 2.5 sacks.\n\nCanty played in the season opener at the San Diego Chargers and recorded his first NFL tackle along with a quarterback pressure. Against the Washington Redskins he added his first career sack with a third-quarter tackle of Mark Brunell. He was third on the team, first among linemen with a season-high six tackles at the Oakland Raiders. He also added a half sack and a tackle for a loss. Canty had two tackles against the Philadelphia Eagles as the defense limited the Eagles to 129 total yards, including just 19 on the ground, the fourth lowest rushing total in franchise history. Canty had a season-high two quarterback pressures against the Arizona Cardinals as well as a tackle and a tackle for a loss. At Philadelphia, he played mostly on first and second downs, recorded two tackles, a tackle for a loss and a forced fumble. Canty led all linemen with three tackles and added his second sack of the season against the Denver Broncos. At the New York Giants, he earned his first NFL start, replacing (Greg) Ellis at right end, and recorded four tackles. He started, again, the next week against the Kansas City Chiefs and led all defensive linemen with five tackles despite suffering a sprained ankle during the game. He did not start but did play at Washington after missing two days of practice due to the injured ankle. He recorded two tackles and a tackle for a loss at the Carolina Panthers. In the season finale against the St. Louis Rams, Canty led all defensive linemen with five tackles and also had a tackle for a loss.\n\nIn 2006, the team moved to a 3-4 defense and Canty earned the starting role at right defensive end. He went on to start all 16 regular season games and Dallas's lone playoff game. He recorded 33 tackles and 1 sack.\n\nIn 2007, he registered 43 tackles (30 solo), 3.5 sacks, and 2 passes defensed. In the Cowboys lone playoff game, their third game against the New York Giants on the season, Canty registered three tackles (two solo), one sack and one pass defensed.\n\nAfter the Cowboys made the decision to give a five-year extension to Jay Ratliff, on June 11, 2008 season, Canty signed a one-year tender offer worth $2.017 million to remain with the team. He started all 16 games for a third consecutive year, producing 37 tackles (25 solo), 3 sacks and a career-high 5 passes defensed.\n\n===New York Giants===\nOn March 1, 2009, Canty signed with the New York Giants; the six-year contract is worth $42 million, with $17.25 million guaranteed. He was named the starter at right defensive tackle in then team's 4-3 defense, but missed eight games with knee and hamstring injuries. In 2011, he registered career-high marks in tackles (47) and sacks (4).\n\nOn August 27, 2012, Canty was placed on the physically unable to perform list after it was determined he would need more time to recover from off-season knee surgery. On October 20, he was activated off the PUP list. On November 2, he was fined $15,750 for roughing the passer. Canty suffered a sprained MCL on December 23, against the Baltimore Ravens and missed the season finale. After playing in only 9 games, he registered 25 tackles (20 solo) and 3 sacks.\n\nHe was released on February 6, 2013, in a salary cap move.\n\n===Baltimore Ravens===\nCanty signed as a free agent with the Baltimore Ravens on March 12, 2013. He registered 30 tackles, 2 sacks and 2 forced fumbles, while playing left defensive end in then Raven's 3-4 defense. In 2014, he missed five games while battling ankle injuries and a staph infection in his wrist. He was cut by the Ravens on February 27, 2015. The Ravens then signed him again on March 18, 2015.\n\n===Statistics===\nSource: [http://www.nfl.com/players/chriscanty/profile?id=CAN796581]\n\n==Personal life==\nCanty's mother, Shirley, is an ordained United Methodist minister, his father, Joseph, Sr., is retired. One of his brothers is the president of Chris's foundation and the other is a college football coach.\n\nIt has been stated by Canty that his all-time favorite movies are Independence Day and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. He is now a member of the \"Hahn & Humpty\" radio show on New York's 98.7 ESPN Radio.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140311211048/http://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/roster/Chris-Canty/1631b814-cc8a-43d1-b9d7-a5e25d0e5af7 Baltimore Ravens bio] *[https://web.archive.org/web/20061102122417/http://virginiasports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/canty_chris00.html University Virginia Cavaliers bio] \n\n{{Super Bowl XLVI}}{{Cowboys2005DraftPicks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canty, Chris}}Category:1982 birthsCategory:Living peopleCategory:American football defensive endsCategory:American football defensive tacklesCategory:Baltimore Ravens playersCategory:Dallas Cowboys playersCategory:New York Giants playersCategory:Players of American football from New YorkCategory:Sportspeople from the BronxCategory:Virginia Cavaliers football playersCategory:Super Bowl champions","tags":["is","League","free"],"dateCreated":1496681064917,"dateModified":1496681064917},{"id":4786259,"title":"Septum intermedium","text":"{{Infobox embryology| Name = Septum intermedium| Latin =| GraySubject = 135| GrayPage = 512| Image = Gray467.png| Caption = Interior of dorsal half of heart of human embryo of about thirty-five days.| Image2 = Gray468.png| Caption2 = Same heart as in Fig. 467, opened on right side.| Days = 35| System =| MeshName =| MeshNumber =| DorlandsPre =| DorlandsSuf =}}Endocardial cushions project into the atrial canal, and, meeting in the middle line, unite to form the septum intermedium which divides the canal into two channels, the future right and left atrioventricular orifices.\n\n==References==\n{{Gray's}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://staff.um.edu.mt/acus1/Heart-b.htm Overview at edu.mt]\n\n{{Development of circulatory system}}\n\nCategory:Embryology of cardiovascular system\n\n{{developmental-biology-stub}}","tags":["References","Name","Image"],"dateCreated":1496681064958,"dateModified":1496681064958},{"id":48302728,"title":"A (sailing yacht)","text":"{{italic title}}Sailing Yacht A is an auxilliary schooner built in Kiel by Nobiskrug for Andrey Melnichenko.

He was educated at Kettering National School and later at St. Mark's College in Chelsea where he was a Queen's Scholar. He became a lecturer on scientific matters for the South Kensington Museum, and was headmaster of Mottram Grammar School from 1868 to 1878. In 1878 the board of governors sent him to Western Australia to found the Fremantle Grammar School. He became the school's headmaster from its establishment in 1885 until 1889, when he resigned to open his own school. The governors of his old school were presented with Briggs leaving and all the pupils following him. He later purchased the Fremantle Grammar School and returned as its headmaster until 1897. (The grammar school closed in 1905 and that was put down to Briggs' interest in politics.)\n\nBriggs became secretary of the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce in 1883, holding the position until 1895. In that year he became a Justice of the Peace. On 30 June 1896, Briggs was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Council for the West Province in a by-election occasioned by the resignation of Edward Davies. He became heavily involved in the Federation movement, becoming president of the Fremantle branch of the Australian Federation League, and representing Western Australia at a series of federal conventions, including the National Australasian Convention in Adelaide in 1897, and the Australasian Federal Conventions in Sydney in 1897 and Melbourne in 1898. On 7 June 1900 he was appointed Chairman of Committees in the Legislative Council, holding the office until 20 June 1906, when he was promoted to President of the Legislative Council. He would hold the presidency until his death 13 years later.\n\nBrigg's contributions during his parliamentary career include examining a scheme of commercial qualifications in 1904, and being a member of the 1910 Royal Commission into the establishment of the University of Western Australia.

Designed by a team of architects under the management of Konstantin Thon, it was intended to emphasise the greatness of Russian autocracy. Konstantin Thon was also the architect of the Kremlin Armoury and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. \n\nThe Grand Kremlin Palace was formerly the tsar's Moscow residence. Its construction involved the demolition of the previous Baroque palace on the site, designed by Rastrelli, and the Church of St. John the Baptist, constructed to a design by Aloisio the New in place of the first church ever built in Moscow. \n\nThon's palace is 125 metres long, 47 metres high, and has a total area of about 25,000 square metres. It includes the earlier Terem Palace, nine churches from the 14th, 16th, and 17th centuries, the Holy Vestibule, and over 700 rooms. The buildings of the Palace form a rectangle with an inner courtyard. The building appears to be three stories, but is actually two. The upper floor has two sets of windows. The west building of the Palace held state reception halls and the imperial family's private chambers ([http://www.kremlin2000.ru/pict/388-389.jpg picture)]. \n\nIts five reception halls (Georgievsky, Vladimirsky, Aleksandrovsky, Andreyevsky, and Ekaterininsky) are named for orders of the Russian Empire: the Orders of St. George, Vladimir, Alexander, Andrew, and Catherine. Georgievsky Hall is used today for state and diplomatic receptions and official ceremonies. International treaties are signed at the Vladimirsky Hall. It also leads to the Palace of Facets, Tsarina's Golden Chamber, Terem Palace, the Winter Palace, and the Palace of Congresses. Aleksandrovsky Hall and Andreyevsky Hall were combined in Soviet times to be used for meetings and conferences of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR; they were lavishly restored in accordance with Thon's designs in the 1990s. Currently it is the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation though it is rarely used for this purpose.\n\n<gallery>File:Kremlin_27.06.2008_01.jpg|View from the Moskva RiverFile:Andreyevsky Zal.jpg|The Hall of the Order of St. Andrew in the Grand Kremlin PalaceFile:Grand Kremlin Palace Georgievsky hall.jpg|The Hall of the Order of St. George in the Grand Kremlin PalaceFile:Grand Kremlin Palace Aleksandr hall.jpg|The Hall of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky in the Grand Kremlin PalaceFile:Grand Kremlin Palace Vladimirsky hall.jpg|The Hall of the Order of St. Vladimir in the Grand Kremlin PalaceFile:Kremlingrand.jpg|The exterior of the Grand Kremlin Palace incorporates many details characteristic of medieval Russian and Byzantine architectureFile:The Grand Kremlin Palace in 2015.JPG|Grand Kremlin Palace Facade the Armoury and Borovitskaya Tower at lower leftFile:Nicholasbotman(1).jpg|Nicholas I in front of the Grand Kremlin Palace</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}*[http://www.kremlin2000.ru Russian site on the Kremlin palaces]*[http://kreml.ru/en/kremlin/buildings/BKD/ Official Kremlin Museums Site]*[http://www.moscowkremlin.ru/IE3/russian/28.html Большой Кремлевский дворец]*[http://www.techsatish.net/2013/07/great-kremlin-palace-moscow-russia.html]\n\n{{Kremlin}}{{Imperial palaces in Russia}}\n\nCategory:Moscow KremlinCategory:Official residences in RussiaKremlinCategory:Royal residences in RussiaCategory:Houses completed in 1849Category:Russian Revival architectureCategory:1849 establishments in Russia","tags":["the","the","Grand"],"dateCreated":1496681064954,"dateModified":1496681064954},{"id":6306823,"title":"Onken","text":"Onken may refer to:\n\n* 12868 Onken, a Main-belt Asteroid* Anne Onken (b. 1977), German radio presenter and comedian* Onken GmbH, German dairy company founded by Hermann Onken, now part of Emmi AG\n\n==See also==\n*Oncken (disambiguation)\n\n{{disambiguation}}Category:Surnames","tags":["to","now","Anne"],"dateCreated":1496681089636,"dateModified":1496681089636},{"id":6912773,"title":"Simmone Jacobs","text":"{{MedalTableTop}}{{MedalSport | Women’s Athletics}}{{MedalCountry| {{GBR2}} }}{{MedalCompetition|Olympic Games}}{{MedalBronze| 1984 Los Angeles | 4 x 100 metres}}{{MedalCompetition|European Championships}}{{MedalBronze|1990 Split | 4 x 100 metres}}{{MedalCountry| {{ENG}} }}{{MedalCompetition|Commonwealth Games}}{{MedalSilver|1990 Auckland | 4 x 100 metres}}{{MedalBronze|1994 Victoria | 4 x 100 metres}}{{MedalBronze|1998 Kuala Lumpur | 4 x 100 metres}}{{MedalBottom}}\n\nKim Simmone Geraldine Jacobs (born 5 September 1966) is a British athlete who competed in the 100 metres and 200 metres.

In 1757, it split away from the parish of Cevio to become its own parish.\n\nThe slopes around the village were heavily terraced, creating most of the farm land for the village. Rye, hemp, flax and later potatoes were grown on the terraces. As a result of emigration out of Switzerland in the 19th Century and emigration to the cities after 1950, most of the fields, meadows and pastures were abandoned. In 2000, no one in Linescio worked in agriculture. On the right side of the valley, there is some mining. At the beginning of the 21st Century a project was developed to save the terraces from decay.\n\n==Geography==\nLinescio has an area, {{as of|1997|lc=on}}, of {{convert|6.61|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

All the water in the municipality is flowing water. Of the unproductive areas, 17.7% is unproductive vegetation and 12.1% is too rocky for vegetation.\n\nThe village is located in the Vallemaggio district, on the left side of the lower portion of the Valle di Campo. It was created in 1858, when the village separated from Cevio.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Quartered argent and azure a dove displayed counterchanged.

It was founded in 1981 by guitarist and sole-constant member Akihito Kinoshita, who is responsible for producing, engineering and composing most of the band's work. Saber Tiger has released nine studio albums, four compilation albums, a live album, two EPs and one single. Their latest release Decisive, is seemingly becoming one of their best selling albums to date. \n\n==Biography==\nSaber Tiger was formed in 1981 by guitarist Akihito Kinoshita. After releasing three albums through an independent record label, the band had what appeared to be a temporary break-up. However, Kinoshita worked around this and signed a major label contract with Tokuma Japan Communications. Saber Tiger's 1997 major debut album, Project One, thrust the band to the front of the flourishing Japanese metal scene. The album is essentially a solo album from Kinoshita, with famous guest musicians; vocalist Ron Keel (ex-Steeler and Keel), bassist Naoto Shibata (Anthem), and drummer Hirotsugu Honma (ex-Ezo and Loudness).\n\nSaber Tiger then went on to record and release three hit albums (as well as a few others) while officially reformed with Takenori Shimoyama on vocals, Tomohiro Sanpei on bass, and Yoshio Isoda on drums.\n\nWorking together they produced two more albums, Paragraph 3 and Brain Drain. In 2001, Saber Tiger made their first release under their new major label VAP, naming the album simply Saber Tiger. With VAP they continued on to release F.U.S.E., The History of the New World -凶獣伝説- and the single \"Eternal Loop\". Paragraph 3 and The History of the New World -凶獣伝説- were re-recorded compilations of the band's signature songs, with the new line-up and a heavier, more driven sound. They also released a live album named Live 2002 Nostalgia, on both CD and DVD.\n\nIn 2002, due to different musical ideas and goals, Shimoyama left the band to pursue his own ambitions in the heavy metal music scene. He formed the band Double Dealer, with Norifumi Shima. They signed a European-wide record contract with NTS/Limb Music, traveling through Europe on a tour with Symphony X.\n\nAfter Shimoyama's departure, Saber Tiger continued to write and record new music, producing the album Indignation in 2005, with vocalist Katsuto Suzuki.\n\nIn 2010, Saber Tiger announced the reunion with former members Takenori Shimoyama (vocals), Yasuharu \"Machine\" Tanaka (guitar) and Tomohiro Sampei (bass), and with Yasuhiro Mizuno as their new drummer. Eventually Takanobu Kimoto (ex-Double Dealer and Concerto Moon) replaced Sampei on bass. They began working on a new album at a studio in their hometown of Sapporo. The album Decisive was released on August 3, 2011, and was followed by a tour. On May 26, 2013, they performed at the Pure Rock Japan Live 2013 at Club Citta, alongside NoGoD, Galneryus and Onmyo-Za.\n\n==Members==\n*Akihito Kinoshita - guitar, leader*Yasuharu \"Machine\" Tanaka - guitar*Takenori Shimoyama - vocals*Yasuhiro Mizuno - drums\n\n===Former members===\nVocals:*Masahiro Imai*Takayuki Takizawa*Hiroyuki Yamaguchi*Yasuo Sasai*Youichi Koizumi*Toru Watanabe*Yoko Kubota*Ron Keel*Katsuto Suzuki*Sakebi\n\nGuitar:*Hidetoshi Takeda\n\nBass:*Masahiro Imai*Fumiaki Sato*Takayuki Takizawa*Akira Mogi*Masahiko Hoshiba*Yuichi Hayase*Tomohiro Sampei*Takashi Yamazumi*Satoru Takeuchi*Naoto Shibata*Tomohiro Sanpei*Takanobu Kimoto\n\nDrums:*Yoshio Isoda*Koji Imai*Shinichi Shirai*Masafumi Minato*Hiroyuki Sugano*Junichi Sasaki*Mitsuhiro Tsuji*Yuichi Sugiyama*Nobuyuki Kodera*Akihiro Iiyama*Hirotsugu Homma*Hideaki Yumida\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n*Invasion (April 21, 1992)*Agitation (August 25, 1994)*Timystery (October 25, 1995)*Project One (February 5, 1997)*Brain Drain (February 21, 1998)*Saber Tiger (January 24, 2001), Oricon Albums Chart Peak Position: No.&nbsp;81*F.U.S.E.

Was equipped with a dirt runway. Since the autumn of that year began to be implemented the first flights of aircraft Antonov An-2, Ilyushin Il-14, first began to fly helicopters.\n\nIn 1966, the airport received the first cargo plane Antonov An-12. Besides him, the flights took place on the An-24 Antonov An-26, Ilyushin Il-14, Antonov An-2, Yak-12, Mi-2, Mi-4. In winter, on a runway compacted snow, was held marking the runway dimensions, which allowed to take cargo aircraft IL-76.\n\nIn the 1970s. value of the airport, \"Ust-Kut\" has increased in connection with the construction of the Baikal Amur Mainline and the opening of new diamond-mining areas in Yakutia. Introduced passenger flights on the An-90 and Yak-40. Building built aircraft maintenance base fuel storage, cargo warehouse, the building control centers and other facilities of air traffic control.\n\nIn the 1980s. Airport reaches its peak and the volume of shipments of goods has a leading position in the Eastern Siberia Department of Civil Aviation. Reception and release of air by satisfying the clock. In 1983, through the airport, \"Ust-Kut\" posted 228.3 thousand passengers, 26.7 thousand tons, 536 tons of mail load. Built a concrete platform building rescue station, a dock for maintenance of helicopters.

Along with Karate Kid, Batman, Bronze Tiger and Lady Shiva he is considered one of the top martial artists in the DC Universe.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Original history===\nAs a teenage sneak thief in Japan, young Richard Dragon broke into a Chinese dojo outside of Kyoto to steal a priceless jade Buddha. Before he could get away, Dragon was caught and beaten by the dojo's teenage student, Ben Turner. O-Sensei, the dojo's master, saw something worth nurturing in Richard, and for the next seven years taught Ben and Richard, side by side, mastery of the martial arts. Richard came to find an inner peace, only using his skill when absolutely necessary. Once he felt there was nothing more he could teach them, the O-Sensei left the two. Turner and Dragon were recruited by Barney Ling, head of the law-keeping espionage agency known as G.O.O.D. (Global Organization of Organized Defense), to join the organization. Together Ben and Richard would defeat the corrupt businessman Guano Cravat, foiling his plans to instigate a war for his own benefit. Ben and Richard founded a martial arts dojo in Manhattan, and Richard would go on to battle international threats such as Telegram Sam, the Preying Mantis, the League of Assassins, and his former superior, Barney Ling. \n\nThirsty for revenge, Cravat would arrange for the murder of Carolyn Wu-San, one of O-Sensei's god-daughters. Aided by Barney Ling, Cravat tricked Carolyn's sister, Sandra Wu-San, into believing Dragon was the murderer. Consumed with a need for revenge, Sandra trained to the peak of human capability, mastering martial arts to defeat Dragon. When the two masters finally met in battle, however, Dragon was able to show Sandra that Cravat had deceived her. Without Dragon's death as a goal, Sandra no longer had a need for her martial arts mastery. Sensing she needed guidance, Dragon helped her to explore the spiritual side of martial arts. Ultimately deciding that she was Sandra no more she rechristened herself \"Shiva\". She fought crime with Dragon and Ben Turner until the three parted ways. Turner, brainwashed by the villainous Sensei of the League of Assassins, became the renegade Bronze Tiger. Dragon decided to retire, devoting himself to teaching others. Lady Shiva became one of the world's greatest assassins.\n\n====Training the Question====\nAfter the character's title was canceled, Dragon became a supporting character in the 1980s series, The Question. The title character of that book, Vic Sage, was a masked crime-fighter based in Hub City, who came into conflict with Lady Shiva. After all but killing The Question, Shiva sent him to see Richard Dragon for training. Sage's stubborn streak made him near impossible for most people to teach. However when he met Dragon he found himself reluctant to challenge his new sensei, because Dragon was in a wheelchair. Richard trained The Question both in martial arts and eastern philosophy, forcing him to question his world view and let go of much of his anger. Of note, he loosely quoted Zhuangzi's story \"The Butterfly Dream\". Later Richard would start referring to his student as \"Butterfly\" because of this. Richard said that Shiva had saved Sage because she saw a passion for combat in him while Richard, on the other hand, thought that Sage's passion was for curiosity. Regardless, Richard realized that for Sage to have a spiritual awakening he had to first let go of the self-destructive behaviors that Hub City brought out in him. Thus Richard sent Sage back home. As he left, Sage met Shiva again, and the two briefly sparred. She explained that this fight had been for her to test her own perceptions. She thought she had seen a \"warrior's passion\" in him that was lacking skills, and felt that she had been proved correct since he faced her a second time knowing she had destroyed him the first. Shiva concluded that she had been right about him and Richard wrong, but Sage proposed that maybe he had just been curious what would happen if they fought again, which would make Richard right. Sage adopted the identity of The Question again, futilely trying to save the city.\n\nJust as Sage's doomed efforts to save Hub City threatened to destroy him, Dragon arrived to advise his student. Dragon finally convinced Sage that his crusade to save Hub City was no longer doing anything but destroying him. When Sage collapsed from exhaustion and his injuries, Richard revealed that he was capable of using his legs perfectly, and put Sage in the wheelchair. Dragon had realized he would need the chair to make Sage let down his defences - Sage was so \"full of macho\" that he would never have listened to him otherwise.\n\nThe chair had not been just a charade, however. Richard revealed that he had allowed himself to be handicapped as part of his own learning process, going on to state \"I was a teacher then. I am about to become something else. So I discard that option\". The city had truly degenerated by this point all pretense of law and order long lost. Richard, who had thought his studies had put him beyond such things, found himself shocked and horrified by the actions of people in Hub City. For example, a man was using a dead baby to try and beg for 'milk money'. When Richard and the others uncovered this, he tossed the body into a nearby trash can.\n\nDragon wordlessly met Lady Shiva, who had arrived on the outskirts of Hub City in the helicopter that was to take Sage and Dragon away - she wished to go toward and enjoy the chaos that Sage and Richard were rejecting. Shiva uses force and threats to ensure the pilot would do what she wishes.\n\n====Training Oracle====\nRichard would next appear as sensei to Oracle, helping her to see past her own wheelchair-related limitations. Dragon spends months training her in escrima, the Philippine art of stick fighting, a martial art she could use despite her wheelchair.\n\n====Training Huntress====\nNot long after that, the masked heroine The Huntress became the main suspect in a series of murders. Realizing that her headstrong nature would likely mean her death this time, The Question saved her from her many pursuers (including the police and Batman), and took her to Richard Dragon. Seeing many similarities between her and The Question, Dragon helped teach the adventuress to control her anger and \"slow down\".\n\nAfter Huntress joined the Birds of Prey, Richard Dragon aided her in fighting the Twelve Brothers in Silk, an Asian martial arts squad that provided protection to a major heroin distributor. {{-}}\n\n===Chuck Dixon Revamp===\nIn 2004, the title was revived and the character revamped by Chuck Dixon and Scott McDaniel, only to be canceled after twelve issues. In this short series, Richard Dragon is a bullied school kid who enrolls in a karate dojo to better himself. Unfortunately, the dojo's instructor was a \"mail-order\" black belt, who is later defeated by the Bronze Tiger. The Bronze Tiger then agrees to train young Dragon. He eventually meets and falls in love with Lady Shiva. Although he wins the martial arts tournament she is watching, she chides him for not being able to live up to the powerful name of \"Dragon.\" Shiva becomes Dragon's lover and instructor, and the series touches on their now strained relationship.\n\nThe series begins with the Tiger locating Dragon, who is seeking death by fighting in death matches. He agrees to help Dragon resolve his problems with Shiva if he agrees to stop killing. In tracking Shiva they are confronted by Nightwing and the new Green Arrow, Connor Hawke. Nightwing alludes to Dragon training him, as Dragon trained Bruce Wayne, who passed that training on to Nightwing. \n\nAt the end of the series, Dragon and Shiva are pitted in combat. Dragon gains the upper hand in the fight, and as he begins to deliver his death blow, Shiva's devout followers rush to save her, knocking Dragon away. Unhappy at this disturbance, Shiva attacks and possibly kills her followers before returning to kill Dragon with her signature move, the Leopard Claw. Dragon is, however, resurrected by the demonic Neron who wants Dragon to kill Shiva. Dragon refuses and walks away from Neron, saying that both had held up their parts of the agreement.\n\n===52===\n{{See also|52 (comics)}}Richard Dragon appears starting in Week 26 of the comic book 52, in the mystic city of Nanda Parbat, where he starts to train former Gotham Detective Renee Montoya. His appearance matches that of the Richard Dragon seen before the Dixon reboot (albeit with a full head of long hair, as when training Question and Oracle, rather than balding when training Huntress). In this story Dragon makes references to a conversation he had with The Question in the Question series, contradicting at least some of Chuck Dixon's Richard Dragon series. The 52 series is also where Richard's former student, Vic Sage, dies from cancer.\n\n===The New 52===\nA new version of Richard Dragon is introduced following DC's The New 52 2011 continuity relaunch. A character identifying himself as Richard Dragon first appears in Green Arrow #23 (2013). In Green Arrow #31, he appears leading a team of Green Arrow's enemies, referred to as the Longbow Hunters. In Green Arrow #32 the character identifies himself as Ricardo Diaz, Jr., the namesake son of a drug kingpin who had been killed by John Diggle (posing as Green Arrow). He revealed that after his father's death and the fall of his criminal empire he sought out and found the League of Assassins where his sensei taught him to become a living weapon. He claims that when his sensei also taught him patience and compassion, which he perceived to be a weakness, he killed his sensei and took his name. Diaz/Dragon places a 30-million-dollar bounty on Green Arrow, which three members of the Longbow Hunters (Brick, Killer Moth, and Red Dart) intend to split. Green Arrow is able to defeat all of them with the help of his young half-sister, Emiko. Green Arrow is then reunited with his old partner, John Diggle, after Dragon attempts to kill Diggle by defenestration. In a fight against both Arrow and Diggle, Dragon is able to significantly injure both of them, but is ultimately defeated.\n\n==Students of the Dragon==\nThe following have been trained by Richard Dragon:\n\n* The Question* Huntress* Oracle* Renee Montoya* Lady Shiva\n\nIn the 2004 series, flashbacks indicated that Richard had trained several others, including Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne, and Green Arrow (Connor Hawke). Given that the version of Richard Dragon seen in 52 appeared to be the version seen prior to the 2004 retcon, the canonical nature of these students is unclear.\n\nIn the New 52, the Green Arrow villain who takes the name Richard Dragon (Ricardo Diaz, Jr.) is revealed to have killed the original man by that name, who had been his sensei, explaining the original Richard Dragon's absence from the New 52.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRichard Dragon possesses no superhuman or metahuman powers, but is a superb athlete and a master martial artist. He is also a master of philosophy and specifically as it concerns a heroic lifestyle and he has guided those such as the Huntress or Wonder Woman in the past as to the correct path they need to live. When he focuses his inner energies (usually by touching the jade claw pendant the O-Sensei gave him), his spirit and body become (metaphorically) like unrelenting granite. He is considered one of the top martial artists in the DC Universe.\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* Richard Dragon is mentioned in Batman: Arkham Origins. He is mentioned in Lady Shiva's assassin profile as an associate of Lady Shiva alongside David Cain and Nyssa Raatko.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Green Arrow}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dragon, Richard}}Category:DC Comics superheroesCategory:DC Comics supervillainsCategory:DC Comics martial artistsCategory:DC Comics titlesCategory:Comics characters introduced in 1975Category:Fictional schoolteachersCategory:Characters created by Dennis O'Neil","tags":["GiordanocharacternameRichard","Shivaaliases","fictional"],"dateCreated":1496681089599,"dateModified":1496681089599},{"id":8874186,"title":"Bill Pronzini","text":"{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}{{Infobox writer| image = | image_size = | alt = | caption = | pseudonym = William Hart Davis, Jack Foxx, William Jeffrey & Alex Saxon| birth_name = | birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1943|04|13}}| birth_place = | death_date = | death_place = | resting_place = | occupation = Novelist| language = English| nationality = United States| ethnicity = | citizenship = | education = | alma_mater = | period = | genre = Mystery| subject = | movement = | notableworks = | spouse = Marcia Muller| partner = | children = | relatives = | influences = | influenced = | awards = | signature = | signature_alt = | website = | portaldisp = }}Bill Pronzini (born April 13, 1943) is an American writer of detective fiction.

The branch was built to carry iron ore, the mining of which supported Graysdale and other local towns. It was cut back to end in Graysdale in 1894 due to the shutdown of Bellefonte Furnace, the principal consumer of the local ore. However, the furnace re-opened under new management in the 1890s, and was back to near-full capacity by 1900. Ore mining resumed, the line from Graysdale to Mattern Bank was re-laid in 1900, and a new branch was built from Graysdale to Scotia. However, the furnace was unable to compete with more modern iron and steel mills, and shut down again, permanently, in 1910. The McNitt-Huyett Lumber Company laid a third rail on the line from Mattern Junction to Scotia around this time, to operate its 36&nbsp;inch (91.44&nbsp;cm) logging trains, but both the lumber company and the Bellefonte Central removed their tracks through Graysdale in 1915.\n\nWith the cessation of logging and iron mining, the area largely became vacant. The area is now a residential development, a bedroom community for Penn State.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web | url=http://graysdale.com/ | title=Graysdale Homeowners Association | accessdate=January 28, 2007}}\n\n{{Centre County, Pennsylvania}}\n\nCategory:Nittany ValleyCategory:Unincorporated communities in Centre County, PennsylvaniaCategory:Unincorporated communities in Pennsylvania\n\n{{CentreCountyPA-geo-stub}}","tags":["the","which","It"],"dateCreated":1496681064897,"dateModified":1496681064897},{"id":9890051,"title":"Heckler & Koch HK45","text":"{{Infobox Weapon|name= Heckler & Koch HK45|image= |caption= The Heckler & Koch HK45C Tactical with threaded barrel.|origin=Germany|type=Semi-automatic pistol|is_ranged=yes|service= |used_by= See Users|wars= |designer= Frank Henninger, Larry Vickers, Ken Hackathorn|design_date=|manufacturer=Heckler & Koch|production_date=|number=|variants=HK45 Compact, HK45 Tactical, HK45 Compact Tactical|weight={{convert|770|g|abbr=on}} (HK45)<br /> {{convert|720|g|oz|0|abbr=on}} (HK45 Compact)|length={{convert|204|mm|in|abbr=on}} (HK45)<br /> {{convert|184|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45 Compact)|part_length={{convert|113|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45)<br /> {{convert|99|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45 Compact)|width={{convert|39|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45)<br /> {{convert|39|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45 Compact)|height={{convert|144|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45)<br /> {{convert|129|mm|abbr=on|1}} (HK45 Compact)|crew= |cartridge= |caliber=.45 ACP|action=Short recoil operated, Browning-type tilting barrel, locked breech|rate=|velocity= |range= |max_range= |feed= Detachable box magazine; capacities:* 10 rounds (HK45)* 8 or 10 rounds (HK45C)|sights=Drift adjustable 3-dot Super-LumiNova night sight system}}\n\nThe Heckler & Koch HK45 (Heckler & Koch, .45 ACP) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by the German arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch.\n\n==Overview==\nThe HK45 was designed to meet requirements set forth in the U.S. Military Joint Combat Pistol program which had the purpose of arming the U.S. Military with a .45 ACP semi-automatic pistol instead of the 9mm M9 pistol. The Joint Combat Pistol program was suspended indefinitely in 2006, and the M9 pistol remained the standard issue handgun for the U.S. Military (replaced by the Sig P320 in January, 2017). Even though the Joint Combat Pistol program had ended, HK decided to make the HK45 available on the commercial market as well as to law enforcement and military groups. Heckler & Koch, along with Larry Vickers, an ex-Delta Force operator, and Ken Hackathorn led the development of the HK45 to meet Joint Combat Pistol program requirements which was canceled due to the price of re-arming the entire military.\n\nThe HK45 represents an evolutionary advancement of the Heckler & Koch USP, and shares the same operating principles of that weapon. It is available in the same ten variants as the USP. The HK45 is a full size model pistol, but significant effort went towards making it more ergonomic than the HK USP full-size chambered in .45 ACP by incorporating features found on the Heckler & Koch P2000. These include an extended ambidextrous slide release, a textured ergonomic grip with finger grooves, and interchangeable backstraps to fit differently sized hands. The newer grip and backstraps allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to greater control of the weapon and recoil management. In order to accommodate the smaller, more ergonomic grip, the HK45 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds versus 12 rounds for the USP45. The HK45 also added grip serrations on the front end of the slide, a Picatinny rail in front of the trigger guard for mounting accessories, and an O-ring polygonal barrel similar to the USP Expert and Match models and the Mark 23 for more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling and increased accuracy.\n\nAt least one HK45C Tactical was used in Operation Neptune Spear.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe HK45 is also the first weapon to be manufactured at Heckler & Koch's new facility in Newington, New Hampshire.\n\n==Variants==\nHeckler & Koch also manufactures the HK45 Compact (HK45C), which can use an 8-round and a 10-round magazine. The HK45C features the same improvements as the full-size HK45, but has a more conventional straight grip similar to Heckler & Koch's P2000. This design still allows the user to customize the grip size via interchangeable backstraps.\n\nAn HK45 Tactical (HK45T) and HK45 Compact Tactical (HK45CT) are also available; these variants include an extended threaded barrel for suppressors, and tritium front and rear sights. Extended threaded barrels compatible with the HK45 and HK45C are also available for purchase from Heckler & Koch USA.\n\n==Users==\n\n*{{flag|Australia}}: HK45 was adopted by the Tactical Response Group of the Western Australia Police in 2008 *{{flag|United States}}: The HK45C / HK45CT was adopted by the United States Naval Special Warfare Command under the designation Mk 24 Mod 0.<br>Also adopted by the Fort Lee Police Department in 2013{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and the Maine State Police in June 19, 2011.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*Heckler & Koch P30 - Chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum and 40S&W, it shares Heckler & Koch's current design aesthetic with the HK45.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{IMFDB title|Heckler_&_Koch_HK45|Heckler & Koch HK45}}*[http://hk-usa.com/hk-models/hk45/ Official HK45 page from Heckler & Koch USA]*[http://hk-usa.com/hk-models/hk45-compact/ Official HK45C page from Heckler & Koch USA]*[http://photos.imageevent.com/smglee/cltactical/HK%20Military%20LE%20Catalog.pdf 2008 Heckler & Koch Military and LE brochure]*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130126141040/http://lundestudio.com/2007SHOTShow/ Report on the 2007 Shot Show, featuring photos of the HK45 and HK45C]*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ybRq9Empk HK45 video review on YouTube]*[http://pistol-training.com/archives/category/range-reports/hk45 Reports on a Heckler & Koch P45 .45 ACP endurance test over 50,000 rounds conducted by pistol-training.com]\n\n{{HK firearms}}{{ModernUSInfWeaponsNav}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heckler and Koch HK45}}Category:Heckler & Koch pistolsCategory:.45 ACP firearms","tags":["See","Heckler","HKbr"],"dateCreated":1496681089589,"dateModified":1496681089589}]}
